      "title": "'A really dangerous circle' - Arteta on Arsenal injuries",
      "content": "Mikel Arteta has had to battle with injuries to key players throughout the season.\nMikel Arteta says Arsenal are caught in a \"really dangerous circle\" with injuries - but denied they are a result of overtraining.\nArsenal have suffered injuries to a number of key players throughout the season and will be without midfielder Declan Rice, defender William Saliba and forward Leandro Trossard for the match against Club Brugge in the league phase of the Champions League on Wednesday.\nTrossard, who scored in the loss to Aston Villa at the weekend, only just returned from injury but was brought off before the end of the game despite only being introduced as a second-half substitute.\nArsenal are still without forward Kai Havertz and defenders Gabriel Magalhaes and Cristhian Mosquera, while striker Viktor Gyokeres is just returning from injury.\nThe Gunners have also made a change to their Champions League squad because of injury, with Gabriel Jesus, who has been out since January after cruciate ligament surgery, replacing 15-year-old Max Dowman - who picked up his injury playing for Arsenal Under-21s in a friendly against Manchester United on Saturday.\nBut when asked if overtraining was the cause of the problems, Arteta rejected the idea.\n\"No, because we don't train.\" Arteta said referring to the short turnaround between games at this point in the season before saying his side trained for \"20 minutes\" on Tuesday.\n\"We don't have time to train. So training is not there but obviously the fact that you are missing players, you are loading other players more [as] a consequence. It's a really dangerous circle that one.\"\nArsenal also had to deal with long-term injuries to Havertz and Bukayo Saka last season, while centre-back Gabriel missed an important couple of months at the end of the last campaign.\nAnd Arteta said that alongside the Arsenal medical team he was always looking at the reasons for the injuries they suffer.\n\"Some of the players have played over 150 games in two seasons so it starts to get overloaded. You start to ask them again and again and again to do that [and] at some point they will break down,\" he said.\n\"It's something that we are constantly looking at. We have played a lot of games with a lot of players missing that puts a lot of stress and then more injuries but we are on it.\n\"I'm really happy what we're doing in terms of the medical stuff and everything that we are trying to bring together, but sometimes as well we need some things to go on our side.\"\nThe football calendar has been been a much-debated topic in recent months.\nArsenal and Crystal Palace have had matches moved by the Premier League later this month to ease fixture congestion.\nArsenal's trip to Everton and Palace's game at Leeds - both originally scheduled for 14:00 GMT on Sunday, 21 December - will now be played at 20:00 a day earlier.\nThe games were shifted as the two sides play each other in the EFL Cup quarter-final on 23 December.\nArsenal have already played 22 games across all competitions as they compete in the Premier League, the Champions League and the Carabao Cup. They start their FA Cup campaign in January against Portsmouth.\nLast year the top European leagues, including the Premier League, and global players' union Fifpro filed a legal complaint against world governing body Fifa over what they called its \"abuse of dominance\" in the game.\nThe European Leagues, which represents 39 leagues and 1,130 clubs in 33 countries, said at the time that it was filing the complaint to the European Commission to protect the welfare of players.\nLast month Fifa announced a series of measures it said would address player welfare, including having at least 72 hours of rest between matches, and a rest period of at least 21 days at the end of each season.\nHowever Fifpro - which was not involved in talks prior to the announcement - accused Fifa of undermining plans to tackle player welfare issues by consulting with \"Fifa-friendly organisations for consultation processes rather than engaging with the recognised football representative bodies\".\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

      "title": "Are Man Utd turning the tide or is a 'bad result just around corner'?",
      "content": "This video can not be played\nWolves booed as Man Utd score four\nIn the one step forward, one step back world Manchester United are living in just now, they took a stride in the right direction against Wolves at Molineux.\nWhether it is significant or not remains to be seen.\nAfter all, the big win at Crystal Palace nine days ago was followed by a dire draw against third-from-bottom West Ham.\nBefore that, a three-match winning run was followed by three games without a win, culminating in a home defeat by an Everton side reduced to 10 men after less than 15 minutes.\nMonday night's 4-1 drubbingof a hapless Wolves was United's biggest win of the season, equalling a four-goal haul Ruben Amorim's side have not bettered in the Premier League since he came to the club 13 months ago.\nUnited had 27 shots, their most in a Premier League game under the Portuguese manager. They have now led in games for longer this season than they did in the entirety of the 2024-25 campaign.\nYet Amorim felt compelled to add a caveat, making reference to Wolves' lack of points on the pitch and mutinous atmosphere off it.\n\"This is a specific case,\" he said. \"We faced a team that is really, really struggling.\n\"You can sense it in every situation of the game.\n\"This moment for Wolves is really hard, as a team and as a club. We took advantage of that.\"\nIt is why Amorim felt United were in danger of blowing a significant chance to climb into the top six and on the coattails of the sides in contention for Champions League qualification.\nNew Wolves boss Rob Edwards felt his side played the way he wanted in the final 15 minutes of the opening period. That included scoring their first goal in 540 minutes through Jean-Ricner Bellegarde.\nIt wasn't the script Amorim envisaged. Certainly not one he wanted on a night when Sir Jim Ratcliffe had come to watch and was pictured in animated conversation with director of football Jason Wilcox in the directors' box.\nHe told his players this before he left to sit in the visitors' dugout alone with his thoughts before United re-appeared for the start of the second half.\n\"We should have finished that half in a different way,\" he said. \"At half-time, they understood we have everything to win the game.\n\"If you need to be really distracted, when you look at Everton, that was three points. We could have had two more points against West Ham. Look at the table. Look at the environment. Look at everything.\n\"We needed to win the second half. It didn't matter the result.\"\nAnalysing the game for Sky Sports, Jamie Carragher praised the performance but said: \"We make the assumption there is a bad result around the corner.\"\nHe is not on his own with that opinion. United have still kept only one clean sheet in the Premier League, against Sunderland at Old Trafford on 4 October. Are they on one defeat in nine, or two wins in six?\nAfter failing to take opportunities to go second - twice - they are now sixth. If results go their way, they could be fourth once they have played Bournemouth on 15 December. Equally they could slide back into a mid-table position.\nAndoni Iraola's men have taken two points from their past six games but they have won 3-0 on each of their past two visits to Old Trafford.\nNothing is for certain at Manchester United these days, it seems, and that includes the availability of their players.\nAmorim had thought the Netherlands international Matthijs de Ligt would be available for Monday's game after missing the West Ham match with a minor injury. He was wrong. Now the manager says he can't be sure when De Ligt will be fit.\nUnited remain in talks with the respective national associations of Morocco, Ivory Coast and Cameroon, which Amorim said is a \"good sign\" but added he \"doesn't know\" if Noussair Mazraoui, Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo will be cleared to play against Bournemouth before they leave for Africa Cup of Nations duty.\n\"Let's wait for the middle of the week,\" said Amorim.\nAsked what moving into sixth place means, he added: \"Nothing. It's always the same feeling. We should have more points. But that's in the past, let's focus on the future.\"\nManchester United have now been in front for longer this season than they were in the whole of last season\nMason Mount's goal means he has now scored three times in the past four games he has started.\nThe England star is now beginning to make the sustained impacted envisaged when he moved from Chelsea for Â£55m in 2023, before injuries halted his progress.\nIt also means Amorim has options given main striker Benjamin Sesko is currently injured and Mbeumo will be leaving at some point in the near future.\n\"If you compare the past he had in Chelsea, he has a great quality,\" said Amorim.\n\"He can defend. He can attack and the quality when he touches the ball is really good.\n\"It's not a surprise for me. But, of course, we need to take care of him.\n\"But he's going to build that and is going to be really important for our club.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

      "title": "'Disgraceful' Salah comments caused 'carnage' - pundits",
      "content": "Mohamed Salah has scored 250 goals in 420 games for Liverpool\nLiverpool forward Mohamed Salah has been called a \"disgrace\" who has caused \"carnage\" at the club by pundits as the fallout continues from his explosive interview.\nSalah said he feels he has been\"thrown under the bus\"after being dropped to the bench for struggling Liverpool's past three games, which led to him being left out of the squad for Tuesday's Champions League match at Inter Milan.\nThe two-time Premier League winner's remarks have led to stinging criticism from former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher and ex-Blackburn and Celtic striker Chris Sutton.\n\"I thought it was a disgrace,\" Carragher said on Sky Sports. \"Some have painted it as an emotional outburst. I don't think it was.\n\"When Mo Salah stops in the mixed zone - which he has done four times in eight years - it is choreographed with him and his agent to cause maximum damage and strengthen his own position.\"\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sutton said: \"Liverpool is carnage because of Mo Salah.\n\"He's been honest and open, but he's made it all about him and not the team. He's been extremely selfish - that's what he's done because now there's a bit of a civil war at Liverpool, and it didn't need to be like this.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot said he was\"surprised\" by Salah's commentsthat their relationship had broken down completely and had \"no clue\" if the 33-year-old would play for the club again.\n\"I don't feel my authority is undermined - it is not the way I feel it,\" said Slot in Milan on Monday.\n\"After tomorrow we will look at the situation. There is always the possibility to return for a player.\"\nOn Tuesday morning, Salah posted animage on social media,externalof himself alone in the gym at Liverpool's training complex.\nEgypt winger Salah will depart for the Africa Cup of Nations next Monday, but with his future at Anfield in doubt it remains to be seen whether he will be involved in Saturday's Premier League home game against Brighton (15:00 GMT).\nThis video can not be played\nSlot has 'no clue' if Salah will play for Liverpool again\nMonday Night Club: âSelfishâ Salah, Villa join title race & Leeds revival\nThis video can not be played\n'He's making it all about him' - Murphy on Salah\nCarragher, who Salah had predicted would \"go for me again\" in his interview, was particularly critical of the timing of the comments, coming after Liverpool had conceded a late equaliser todraw 3-3 at Leedson Saturday evening.\nThe defending Premier League champions have won just four of their past 15 games in all competitions, going back to September, with Slot increasingly finding himself under pressure.\n\"He has waited, I think, for a bad result with Liverpool,\" Carragher said.\n\"Everyone connected with the club feels like they are in the gutter and he has chosen this time to go for the manager - and maybe try and get him sacked.\n\"The one line that stands out for me was 'thrown under the bus'. He has tried to throw the club under the bus twice in the last 12 months.\n\"Going after the owners initially, he complained a year ago because they hadn't given him a contract at the age of 32.\n\"With the manager, he should be doing all he can to help the club get out of the worst run of results they have had since the 1950s.\"\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, former England captain Steph Houghton agreed.\n\"It probably couldn't have come at a worse time for Liverpool,\" she said.\n\"That's what makes us think this is something that was pre-planned. He probably expected to come on at some point [against Leeds], he didn't, and for Mo Salah that probably hurts his ego.\n\"But it's poor from him. I think it does put other people in jeopardy. It's got us talking about it, which he wants.\"\nCarragher also called for Salah not to be \"obsessed\" with his own numbers and suggested he should help the other players, such as big-money signings Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, who are hoping to emulate his success at the club.\n\"Some of the criticism has been excessive this season, but I will go after Mo Salah when he tries to throw my club under the bus off the pitch and just thinks about himself,\" Carragher added.\n\"The club have made the right decision in him not going abroad with them and whether he will play for the club again I don't know.\n\"I hope he does because he is one of the greatest players we have ever had.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'He's put his team-mates in jeopardy' - Coady\nAfter a stellar season in 2024-25, in which he spearheaded Liverpool's surge to the title, Salah has been short of his best this campaign with only five goals in 19 games.\n\"He's had a phenomenal career,\" Sutton said.\n\"This season he hasn't played so well, his numbers are down, he's not the same player and all of a sudden he's been left out for a few games and wants to live by different rules than other players in the dressing room.\n\"I find the whole situation absolutely ridiculous.\n\"What good could come out of what he did? What sickens me a bit about it is when Liverpool have been doing well, and players come out and speak, 'it's the team spirit, we all get on so great and everything's marvellous'.\n\"And now we're seeing Mo Salah for what he really is. It's all about him. It's him being selfish. I hate that sort of stuff. I think he's really let himself down here.\n\"It's all about who will go - will it be Slot or will it be Salah? And how is that beneficial for someone who loves the club so much?\"\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Wrexham's former Everton and Wolves defender Conor Coady, who began his career in Liverpool's academy, added: \"I could only think that something has gone on behind the scenes that we don't know about.\n\"He should never, ever go to the press and do what he's done because you put your team-mates in jeopardy, and that's the most important thing. That's the biggest wrongdoing he can do in my eyes.\"\n'I am not weak' says Slot, but Salah could return\nSalah says he has been 'thrown under the bus' by Liverpool\nSalah left out by Liverpool for Inter Milan game\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

      "title": "Who has made Troy's Premier League team of the week?",
      "content": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\nBart Verbruggen (Brighton):He made four or five really good saves and kept them in the game in thedraw against West Ham. On another day West Ham go on to win that. He was bang on it and a big reason why Brighton nicked a draw.\nMatty Cash (Aston Villa):Wonderful goal as Aston Villabeat Arsenaland great defending. As a Birmingham fan it pains me to give him credit but he was great and Aston Villa were fantastic. Everyone feels Arsenal are going to run away with the league, but Aston Villa said \"no, not on my watch\".\nMarc Guehi (Crystal Palace):He got his team over the line for theirwin at Fulhamand led by example as he always does. He got my mind thinking - not only did he play well this weekend and has been great all season, how much would Liverpool not be in this mess if they had managed to sign him? How good could Liverpool be if they had a proper centre-half like him?\nMarco Senesi (Bournemouth):I don't know where Bournemouth keep getting these players from. They sold two centre-halves in the summer and he has just stepped in no problem. He's been absolutely fantastic, and was again as theyshut out Chelsea.\nBruno Guimaraes (Newcastle):I'm putting Bruno at the base of a diamond in midfield because he is the heart, soul and spirit of Newcastle's team, and was brilliant againagainst Burnley. He is just a very good football player and there are not many people you can say that about.\nAnton Stach (Leeds):He was the player who stood out for Leeds in theirdraw with Liverpool. The visitors were obviously cruising but I look at players and teams in that moment and look at who is hiding. This guy turned it up - not only a notch but another 10 notches - scored a goal and got an assist.\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Everton):Is he the signing of the season? He has been fantastic. Not only is he scoring, he is pulling the strings and has become the heartbeat of this new-look Everton team under David Moyes, who can get another gear out of these players as they didagainst Nottingham Forest.\nBruno Fernandes (Manchester United):Top of the diamond is Fernandes. Two goalsat Wolvesand an assist. His passing was fantastic. He loses a bit of credit because it was against arguably the worst team I have ever seen in Wolves, but he did very well. Manchester United are back on the winning trail.\nXavi Simons (Tottenham):He has had a bit of a tough time at Spurs but it felt like this was his moment to show everyone why people think he is so talented. He has pace, power and glides past people. We used to call people like that a luxury but when you put in a match-winning performance like he didagainst Brentford, you have to start saying he is just good.\nHugo Ekitike (Liverpool):Even though he is in a team that is a shambles, he gets in through the middle. He scored two goals against Leeds. I understand Liverpool spent a lot of money on Alexander Isak - and I am a huge fan - but just start this kid. Get the two of them up front and figure it out.\nRayan Cherki (Manchester City)My favourite footballer to watch in world football. Not only was his assist for Phil Foden in thewin against Sunderlandworth the admission fee, he was just delightful. He is like the cult heroes I grew up with and makes me feel like a kid again watching football. Back in the day you had Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Jay-Jay Okocha - a plethora of them. Now there is just Rayan Cherki - and he is fantastic.\nUnai Emery (Aston Villa):A massive game for Aston Villa. Against Arsenal it was that match where he gets to say: \"Remember me? You got rid of me.\" I think with all that being said, Emery is manager of the week.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your team of the week? Have your say using the comments form below:\nHugo Ekitike\nWith Liverpool and Mohamed Salah appearing to bemoving in different directions- and Salah heading to join his Egypt team-mates for the Africa Cup of Nations next week anyway - the Reds need other players to step up and fill the Salah-shaped hole in the scoring charts. In Hugo Ekitike, they may have found that man.\nEkitike is now Liverpool's leading Premier League scorer with five goals, while in all competitions he also tops the charts with eight. On Saturday at Elland Road, the Frenchman scored the first double of his Liverpool career, and with the goals coming in the 48th and 50th minutes, he was the first Premier League player to score twice in the opening five minutes of the second half since Raheem Sterling in March 2019 for Manchester City against Watford.\nHe led all players in the match for shots (5), shots on target (3) and touches in the opposition box (9) and his only disappointment must have been the scoreline - he was the first Liverpool player to score two goals in a Premier League and not win since Salah last December in a 3-3 draw with Newcastle.\nRayan Cherki\nDespite playing just 398 minutes in the Premier League this season, no player has more assists than Manchester City's Rayan Cherki (5), with two of those coming in the 3-0 victory over Sunderland.\nCherki created six chances in open play, the joint most by a player in a Premier League game this season, while at 22 years and 111 days on Saturday he was the second-youngest Manchester City player to achieve that in a Premier League game, older only than - maybe surprisingly - Mario Balotelli in February 2012 against Blackburn Rovers.\nAmong players to play 300 minutes in the Premier League, no player has created more chances per 90 minutes than Cherki (3.4) and only four have had more touches in the opposition box per 90 minutes (7.7). The Frenchman is currently assisting a goal, on average, every 80 minutes - also a league best.\nBruno Guimaraes\nBruno Guimaraes has taken 10 corners in the Premier League this season and it is clear which one of those was most memorable - his in-swinging delivery on Saturday against Burnley caught his former team-mate Martin Dubravka out to give the Magpies the lead.\nIt was not the first Premier League goal direct from a corner(or 'Olympico goal' as it's known)but it was Newcastle's first ever corner to be put directly into the opponent's goal in the Premier League, to give Guimaraes a slice of Magpies history. Given the term Olympico goal originates from South America, it seems apt that four of the past seven direct corner goals have been scored by players from that continent - all, in fact, from Brazil. Those scorers are Matheus Pereira, Douglas Luiz, Matheus Cunha and Guimaraes.\nAside from swinging corners directly into the net, Guimaraes has been in excellent recent form - he now has four goals and two assists across his past nine Premier League appearances, scoring five in total this season. Only in 2023-24 has he ever scored more in one season, netting seven times.\nFollow your Premier League club on BBC Sport\nAll your football quizzes in one place\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

      "title": "'I am not weak' says Slot, but Salah could return",
      "content": "Arne Slot's Liverpool play Inter Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot says he is \"not weak\" and denies the situation with Mohamed Salah has undermined his authority.\nThe 33-year-old winger has been left out of the squad to face Inter Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday aftergiving an explosive interview two days ago, claiming he was \"thrown under the bus\" by Liverpool and his relationship with Slot had broken down.\nSlot says he does not feel that way and was \"surprised\" by Salah's comments.\nSpeaking in Milan on Monday night, Slot added he had \"no clue\" if Salah, whosigned a new two-year contract in April, had played his last game for Liverpool, but added he was a \"firm believer that there is always a possibility to return for a player\".\nHe said his conversation with Salah to tell him he would not travel to Milan was \"a short one\".\n\"Usually I am calm and polite, but that doesn't mean I am weak,\" he said.\n\"If a player has these commands about so many things, then it's about me and the club to react. We reacted in a way you can see - he's not here.\"\nHe added: \"I don't feel my authority is undermined, it is not the way I feel it.\n\"After tomorrow we will look at the situation. There is always the possibility to return for a player. I have no clue [if he has played his last game for Liverpool] - I cannot answer that question at this point in time.\"\n'Disgraceful' Salah comments have caused 'carnage'\nSalah left out by Liverpool for Inter Milan game\nThis video can not be played\nHe's put his team-mates in jeopardy - Coady\nSalah said in his interview it was \"very clear that someone wants me to get all the blame\", but Slot says he does not know if that comment was aimed at him and gave his reasons for leaving Salah out for the past three games.\n\"It is hard for me to know who he was talking about,\" Slot said.\n\"That is not the way I feel. He has the right to feel the way he does, but he does not have the right to share it with the media.\n\"He was very respectful and has trained really hard before the weekend - to that extent it was a surprise to me the comments he gave.\n\"Yes, we were [on speaking terms] but it doesn't mean we were always agreeing on things.\n\"But it is not the first or the last time that a player who is not playing has said something similar to that.\n\"We as a team have struggled this season. I have tried to come up with solutions - that is my job. We tried many things and we looked very vulnerable against Nottingham Forest and PSV so I decided to play with an extra midfielder.\"\nThis video can not be played\nRooney: \"Disrespectful\" Salah comments \"threw Liverpool under the bus\"\nSources told BBC Sport the decision to leave Salah at home was taken with the full support of Slot, and that it is in the best interest of all parties involved for the player to have a brief period away from selection given the nature and timing of his public comments.\nIt is understood there will be no formal disciplinary action taken by the club.\nEgypt forward Salah departs for the Africa Cup of Nations next Monday and also looks likely to miss Liverpool's Premier League home game against Brighton on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\nSalah has scored 250 goals for Liverpool since signing from Roma in 2017, but has just five in 19 games this season.\nSlot has named a 19-man squad for Tuesday, with the Reds also missing forwards Cody Gakpo and Federico Chiesa, and defensive midfielder Wataru Endo.\nAlisson addresses the media at San Siro Stadium\nLiverpool goalkeeper Alisson says Salah's team-mates \"have different thoughts\" about his outburst, but the Brazil international wants the winger to return.\n\"This is not a situation that makes us happy, first and foremost because on a personal level we all love Mo,\" he said.\n\"We were a little bit caught by surprise but we know it is a personal situation so we are leaving it between him and the club.\n\"What we believe does not come into things. What we want is for him and the club to reach an agreement in the best interests of him and the club and all of the playing staff.\n\"I hope he plays again for the club.\"\nHe added: \"We as his team-mates and his friends, we hope the best thing happens for him, but as Liverpool FC players we want the best for the club as well. We want a win-win situation for everyone.\"\nAlisson also backed his manager Slot, adding: \"We believe [in] his style of play and that he is capable of helping us to turn around this situation.\"\nThis video can not be played\nArne Slot reacts to Salah comments\nAlmost 48 hours after Salah spoke, this was Arne Slot's chance to say his piece.\nMonday was a public holiday in Milan but the media conference room inside the San Siro was still packed. It is hard to think of a more anticipated pre-match media conference in recent times.\nSlot used his humour to start off by joking with a reporter that he asked five questions in one, but minute by minute, details began to emerge and it was clear to see who was in charge.\nWhen BBC Sport asked him whether he understood Salah's comments when the Egyptian said he was \"thrown under the bus\", Slot said: \"Usually I'm calm, I'm polite but I'm not weak. If a player has these comments about so many things, then it's up to me and the club to react. We reacted in a way you can see because he's not here.\"\nThis was Slot on the front foot and he was backed later by goalkeeper Alisson, who insisted that the Liverpool squad are firmly behind the manager who won the Premier League.\nThat backing from a senior player was crucial on a night where Slot was asked if he felt his authority was undermined by the whole saga.\nSlot categorically denied he felt that way, even if he was surprised when he heard the quotes on Saturday night.\nThe Liverpool coach did not delve too much into the specifics, insisting that his conversation with Salah was short, but he said enough to explain the situation without inflaming it any further.\nAnd, importantly, the door is still open for Salah even though Slot said he had \"no clue\" whether the 33-year-old has played his last game for the club.\nThe club insist this was mainly because of Salah bringing his own future into question. Their position is that Salah still has a contract and as Slot said, he is a \"firm believer\" in the possibility for a player to return.\nAfter 10 minutes of questions solely focused on Salah, the Liverpool media officer, sitting next to Slot, said it was time to move on to questions about the game itself.\nUltimately though, regardless of how Liverpool fare tomorrow against Inter Milan, this is a story that will continue to dominate the agenda until there is a clear resolution.\nThis video can not be played\n'He's making it all about him' - Murphy on Salah\nThe most iconic and explosive Premier League outbursts\nIs there any way back for Salah and Liverpool?\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

      "title": "Winless Wolves are breaking records - but how bad can things get?",
      "content": "Wolves have been in the Premier League since promotion in 2018\nIt has been 227 days, three managers, two sporting directors, one technical director and 41 goals conceded since Wolves last won in the Premier League.\nRooted to the bottom with just two points and 13 away from safety, their top flight future looks bleak as they are already guaranteed to be bottom of the table on Christmas Day.\nMonday's 4-1 loss at home to Manchester United was their eighth-straight league defeat, their longest losing top flight run in the Premier League era and equalling their all-time top flight run of defeats from 1981-82.\nJean-Ricner Bellegarde's first-half equaliser was just their first league goal since 26 October.\nWolves' haul of only two points this season is the joint-lowest tally after 15 games of a campaign in the history of the top four tiers.\nAngry Wolves fans boycotted the opening 15 minutes against United to protest against Fosun's running of the club - they might have wished they stayed outside.\n\"I understand the frustration,\" said manager Rob Edwards. \"I won't tell fans what to do.\n\"I'd love them to support the players but they have to see effort and commitment in return. Mistakes were punished tonight and that filtered through. There was an anger in the stadium. The lads are trying. The supporters are angry and I get it.\n\"It's the toughest league in the world and we came into a team who hadn't won since April. I wasn't anticipating a quick turnaround.\"\nRelegation to the Championship is becoming almost an inevitability with Derby County's Premier League low of 11 points under serious threat, so will Wolves avoid becoming the worst team?\nIt's important to distinguish this is a completely different Premier League era to Derby's, so the comparisons may feel unfair.\nIt is not a problem purely based on this season either. Since successive seventh placed finishes in 2018-19 and 2019-20 Wolves have slowly slipped down the table.\nIn the past five seasons they have finished 13th, 10th, 13th, 14th and 16th, having needed to replace the manager at least twice to save themselves.\nEdwards is the fifth head coach in four years and third in less than 12 months afterGary O'NeilandVitor Pereira'ssackings.\nThe revolving door of managers has coincided with major changes in the squad as Wolves have sold and failed to replace their star players.\nRaul Jimenez, Ruben Neves, Adama Traore, Pedro Neto, Max Kilman, Conor Coady and Joao Moutinho were all crucial to success under Nuno Espirito Santo and reaching the Europa League quarter-finals in 2020. The summer exits of Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Matheus Cunha are also still being felt.\nThe five who arrived in the summer, excluding Jorgen Strand Larsen after he made his loan from Celta Vigo permanent, had no Premier League experience and are taking too long to adapt.\nEdwards has already admitted they need more know-how, which will be an aim in January - although who they are able to sign will largely depend on how far adrift they have fallen.\nThere have been concerns about the squad's ability to gel, given the number of nationalities, and their fitness - with boss Edwards eager for them to play with his levels of intensity.\nThe Derby side of 2007-08 had six points at this stage of the season and striker Robert Earnshaw, part of the Rams' squad, knows how badly it can go wrong.\nHe told BBC Sport: \"At Derby, the politics around the club disrupted what was going on in the changing room, on the pitch. It was almost as if everyone gave up, it was 20 games to go and it was like 'we're never going to do it'. There was all this negative talk.\n\"It was not an accident the team finished bottom and struggled for points. The club almost relegated itself. There was too much politics going on.\n\"You can relegate yourself based on how you think. If you come in on Monday morning it's heavier to pick yourself up and heavier to look past the results.\"\n\"You've sold the team, now sell the club\" is a regular chant at Molineux from the South Bank as they direct their anger at owners Fosun and executive chairman Jeff Shi.\nThat will not change Fosun's mindset. If Wolves are relegated they will remain and there are no immediate plans to sell, though they are open to minority investment into Fosun Sports Group, having spoken to former Crystal Palace co-owner John Textor in October.\nFormer director of player recruitment and development Matt Jackson was also promoted to technical director last month, a move met with scepticism by fans who want to see wholesale change.\nEven before November's sacking of Pereira, this season was viewed as a new phase for Wolves in terms of reducing the wage bill and transfer fees - while homegrown players will be targeted both in January and beyond.\nWolves are winless from their opening 15 league games.\nThe all-time English record for a top-flight winless start is held by Bolton, who failed to win any of their first 22 games in 1902-03. Unsurprisingly, they finished bottom and were relegated from the First Division.\nSheffield United's Premier League record of 17 winless games is also under threat.\nWolves will have to beat either Arsenal or Brentford to avoid equalling it before ending the year with trips to Liverpool and Old Trafford.\nThe record for the lowest points tally ever recorded at Christmas in the Premier League belongs to the Blades who had two points in 2020, though that was after 14 games following the pandemic delayed the start to the season.\nSunderland hold the record low for a season which started in August with five points from 17 games.\nWest Brom were bottom at Christmas in 2004 and eight points from safety but, under Bryan Robson, became the first team to survive from that position.\nEarnshaw scored 11 goals in 18 starts to keep the Baggies up in that campaign, but feels Wolves are lacking the quality to make a difference.\nHe said: \"Those moments from top players which change games, in an instant, in five or six seconds - Wolves have not got that at all.\n\"They can't score goals. You should be creating four or five good opportunities every half and they can't buy a goal because there's no quality there.\n\"They've got some very good players - Andre, Joao Gomes, Strand Larsen - but something's not quite right. Is it confidence, ability, not looking forward to the challenge? If you are dreading it as a player that's a real worry.\"",

      "title": "Salah left out by Liverpool for Inter Milan game",
      "content": "Salah (pictured at training on Monday) joined Liverpool from Roma in 2017\nMohamed Salah has been left out of the squad for Liverpool's Champions League match at Inter Milan.\nThe club have decided to remove Salah from selection for a short period after he gave an explosive interview on Saturday, claiming that he was \"thrown under the bus\" by Liverpool and his relationship with head coach Arne Slot had broken down.\nSources told BBC Sport that the decision has been taken with the full support of Slot and that it is in the best interest of all parties involved for Salah to have a brief period away from selection given the nature and timing of the player's public comments.\nIt is understood there will be no formal disciplinary action taken by the club.\nThe 33-year-old is set to depart for the Africa Cup of Nations next Monday and also looks likely to also miss Liverpool's game against Brighton on Saturday.\nLiverpool's 19-man squad flew to Milan on Monday afternoon and Slot will speak at the news conference alongside Alisson Becker at 18:45 GMT.\nSalah gave his interview after he was an unused substitute inSaturday's 3-3draw at Leeds United - the third straight game the Egypt international has started on the bench.\n'Disgraceful' Salah comments have caused 'carnage'\n'I am not weak' says Slot, but Salah could return\nThis video can not be played\n'He's put his team-mates in jeopardy' - Coady\nThe Reds let a 2-0 lead slip in the draw at Leeds, with Salah an unused substitute for the game.\nThe previous two games had seen Salah come on as a substitute in a 1-1 home draw at Sunderland, while he was left on the bench in a 2-0 win at West Ham.\nHis last start was in a 4-1 defeat by PSV Eindhoven at Anfield in a Champions League group game and his last goal came in a 2-0 win at Aston Villa on Saturday, 1 November.\nSalah has scored five goals in 18 appearances in the Premier League and Champions League this season.\nOverall, he has 250 goals in 420 Liverpool appearances and his 29 top-flight goals in the 2024-25 campaign helped the Anfield side win the Premier League title last season.\nSalah, who joined Liverpool from Roma in 2017, signed a new two-year contract with the club in April.\nBBC Sport pundit and former England striker Wayne Rooney has said Salah is \"destroying his legacy\" at the club and said prior to the forward being left out of the Inter game that Slot should not involve him in Italy or for the home match against Brighton on Saturday.\n\"In my head, I'm going to enjoy that game because I don't know what is going to happen now,\" Salah said on Saturday.\n\"I will be in Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go to Africa Cup of Nations. I don't know what is going to happen when I am there.\"\nThis video can not be played\nRooney: 'Disrespectful' Salah comments 'threw Liverpool under the bus'\nSalah is destroying his legacy - Rooney\nSalah says he has been 'thrown under the bus' by Liverpool\nIs there any way back for Salah and Liverpool?\nThis video can not be played\nSalah trains but will not travel to Milan\nSalah may not have made the trip to Milan but the fact that he was training with his teammates on Monday morning suggests that there is a way back at Liverpool for the Egyptian.\nLeaving him out of the squad was a decision made in consultation with Slot and it leaves no doubt about who is in charge but it could have been much worse - Salah wasn't even fined by the club for his outburst at Leeds.\nGiven his choice of words, it would not have come as a surprise if Salah wasn't allowed to train with the first team but the 33-year-old was all smiles in front of the cameras on Monday.\nHis words on Saturday implied that an exit in January was possible but BBC Sport understands that the Egyptian isn't actively looking for a way out. And the notion that it is in the best interests of all parties for Salah to have a period away from selection indicates that Liverpool still see a future with the current PFA Players' Player of the Year\nFurthermore, there are currently no plans for Salah to leave Liverpool any earlier than December 15 (which is the latest release date) for the Africa Cup of Nations.\nIt's worth noting Salah's words when he signed his new contract in April: \"I have played eight years here, hopefully it's going to be 10. I'm enjoying my life here, enjoying my football. I have had the best years of my career here.\"\nThere is little doubt that Salah spoke from the heart on Sunday. Missing out on the Inter game will hurt him but here is still a chance for him at Liverpool under Slot and that will be the question on everyone's lips when the Liverpool boss speaks to the media on Monday evening.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

      "title": "'Best boss & team in Palace history' - but will it be a special season?",
      "content": "This video can not be played\nGuehi scores late header to secure Crystal Palace win over Fulham\nFourth in the table, quality all over the pitch and a top manager - Crystal Palace are enjoying their best-ever Premier League campaign.\nMarc Guehi's late header secured a tight 2-1 victory away at Fulham on Sunday, moving the Eagles up into the Champions League places.\nA yield of 26 points from their 15 opening matches is their highest tally at this point in a Premier League season and makes them serious contenders for a place in Europe's top competition next year.\nEddie Nketiah, who opened the scoring at Craven Cottage on his 50th appearance for the club, said \"the sky is the limit\" if his side continue this rich vein of form while manager Oliver Glasner was quick to praise his team.\n\"I could mention many players but it was a huge team effort - that makes me very proud,\" he said.\n\"That's why we are where we are.\"\nBut that praise comes just one week afterGlasner openly criticised the clubfor their lack of summer investment following a 2-1 home defeat by Manchester United.\nWith his contract running out at the end of the season and uncertainty over the future of important players like Guehi and Adam Wharton, concerns remain behind the scenes at Selhurst Park.\nWill Palace's owners be able to keep hold of the manager that has brought them such success? And can Palace maintain this level to truly make this a special season in south London?\nGlasner joined Palace in February 2024 following successful stints at Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt.\nThe 51-year-old has since guided Palace to back-to-back record points totals in the Premier League and led them to a first major trophy when they triumphed over Manchester City in the FA Cup last season.\nThat led to a first ever appearance in a major European competition - although it was downgraded from Europa League to Europa Conference League because of multi-club ownership rules - while they also beat league winners Liverpool to win the Community Shield.\nFormer Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher said on Sky Sports: \"We are watching the best manager and the best team in Crystal Palace's history.\n\"Those supporters could not have dreamed what would happen to their football club when that man came in.\"\nSelhurst Park has become one of the toughest places for teams to play with Palace unbeaten there in the league this season until defeat by United last weekend.\nOn the road, their form is arguably even better.\nSince Glasner's first game in charge in March 2024, only Arsenal (65), Liverpool (57) and Manchester City (55) have won more Premier League points away from home than Crystal Palace (52).\nBut the defeat by United prompted Glasner tocriticise the clubas he suggested the club-record Â£60m brought in by the sale of Eberechi Eze this summer has not been reinvested in the squad.\nHis side have lost all four league matches they have played after a midweek European match this season, suggesting squad depth and juggling the increased schedule demands has been a problem.\nAnd Glasner was quick to point it out, saying the club had \"thrown away\" the chance to play an even better season by not spending in the summer.\n\"When he gets a result he doesn't like, he is not shy in being outspoken about the board or the sporting director,\" said Carragher.\n\"They probably have to take it on the chin because he is the greatest manager in their history.\"\nIt is clear Glasner is an ambitious manager.\nIt is perhaps also clear that he feels he is being held back by a lack of depth in the squad while he will hope his comments spark a flurry of January transfer window action.\nGlasner's contract is set to expire in June and the ambitions of the club and the manager will need to align quickly if the success they are currently enjoying is to continue.\n\"There's a huge talking point around Glasner himself with his contract,\" former Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given told BBC Sport.\n\"If you're a director you're trying to tie him down. The job he's done is phenomenal - winning the FA Cup and Charity Shield and getting Palace into Europe. You couldn't ask for any more.\n\"He was angry and upset after the United game as he felt he wasn't backed in the summer. It will be interesting to see what happens in January and the summer and if they back him.\"\nGuehi's contract runs out at the end of the season and interest from Liverpool in the England defender, who was close to a move away from Palace this summer, is only going to intensify given their defensive troubles.\nProlific playmaker Wharton is a man in demand with several clubs interested in his services.\nMeanwhile, talented players like Ismaila Sarr, who is currently injured but will soon be heading to Afcon, and Jean-Philippe Mateta will certainly have dreams of playing Champions League football.\n\"The squad's not big enough to rest players and it puts more strain on the Premier League games. Top six would be an unbelievable season but big clubs will be trying to do the same,\" Given added.\nThis Palace squad might be in their greatest period ever but they are also on the brink of potentially disbanding with the possibility of a stellar campaign being derailed.\nLatest Crystal Palace news, analysis and fan views\nAsk about Crystal Palace - what do you want to know?",

      "title": "'Everyone follows fashion' - is Premier League better now than 20 years ago?",
      "content": "There seems to be an ongoing debate about how good the Premier League is now, and if it is better than 10 or 20 years ago.\nThe discussion about that in the media or from fans is usually about the quality of football or how exciting it is compared to even a decade ago.\nThis is my view, but from a manager's perspective.\nBefore I start, I want to spell out that I am writing as a former manager, giving my opinion on the game we all love. I would be fascinated to find out what your views are about it.\nWhat do you think about your team's performances? Are you watching a more cultured, possession-based style now than you did 10 or 20 years ago - or are you watching your team play without the drive and commitment of years gone by?\nMy opinion is not only based on performance or style, but also how much has changed off the pitch.\nWalk into most grounds today, as a supporter, manager or player, and you can't help but be impressed. Our stadiums and facilities are the equal or even the envy of any country in world football.\nExactly the same could be said about our training grounds, with state-of-the-art fitness and medical centres of the highest calibre, and the pitches are like bowling greens - absolute perfect surfaces, to play and train on.\nBut has everything changed for the better? Everyone will have a different view on that, but from a manager's perspective these are the areas that matter.\nBrighton, under majority owner and chairman Tony Bloom, are one of only three Premier League clubs to be controlled by English owners, along with Brentford and Tottenham\nI managed 10 clubs and had eight chairmen who were local owners. They were almost as one with the supporters, and understood the value of the club to the community.\nMy relationship with some of them was very strong and I still have great respect for those individuals.\nFor me, understanding the identities of the clubs and towns where I worked without doubt gave me more of a connection with the supporters.\nWorking closely together with my chairman, building a bond between us and having a mutual understanding with them, was always vital for me, especially in difficult moments - and there were lots of them!\nIt enabled me to speak openly with them, often over dinner, and discuss the club's development from my point of view as well as theirs.\nIn my view, it was and still is, the most important relationship at any club, but it is only a dream for the majority of managers today.\nMost Premier League clubs, and many in the Championship, have owners and investors who are based abroad.\nFor these individuals or groups, football is a business and making profits counts as much as gaining points. It's not an option for the manager to sit down with them over a glass of wine to discuss footballing matters.\nWith these changes, more and more different job titles are brought in, from sporting director to director of football and more, that decrease or ultimately prevent any contact personally between the coach or manager and owner.\nIf I was still a manager today, I know which set-up I'd prefer.\nThose in charge of Brighton, Brentford, Stoke, Middlesbrough and Bristol City, where the owners are in England and have a local and personal understanding of the community, should thank their lucky stars.\nNottingham Forest's former Newcastle midfielder Elliot Anderson was back at St James' Park in October. The Magpies were forced to sell the 23-year-old in 2024 to balance the books under PSR rules\nI often hear \"he's one of our own\" proudly shouted by fans, and I love it. It's a symbolic way of showing how much supporters love watching home-grown talent break into their club's first team.\nThe academy system in this country has an enormous pull on young players. Now pre-academy players can join a club when as young as six, and can end up spending more time at the academy than at school.\nThese boys are often local lads who, during their journey, build a strong relationship with the club and their coaches.\nI'm old enough to remember the three West Ham players who helped England win their only World Cup, in 1966 at Wembley, and I am sure everyone reading this can relate to the home-grown talent in your team, and how special the feeling is to know \"he's one of our own\".\nUnfortunately, today's academy players seem to be viewed differently, from a business perspective.\nClubs have realised they can make pure profit from selling academy players and, to balance their finances, top talent is being sacrificed to meet profit and sustainability rules (PSR).\nThis is something that maybe has only just started too. Now, clubs are spending enormous amounts of cash to fill academies with good young foreign talent.\nIs this a football decision, or a future financial 'get out of jail' ticket?\nGuardiola took charge of Manchester City in the summer of 2016\nIt is nine years since Pep Guardiola arrived at Manchester City and brought with him a style of play that was to be followed - and copied - by coaches up and down the country, from the highest professional level to the amateur and youth game.\nAs I talked about in a previous column aboutthe value of defending properly,Pep's style of play did not just become 'the right way' to play, it also became 'the only way'.\nAt the time, without question, City had the strongest squad of players, technically, in the Premier League, but it felt like many other managers and coaches put style over substance and, irrespective of their strengths, many teams were encouraged to play possession-based football.\nI always played to my own squad's strengths, and have never changed my views on that principle, but you still have to admire the complete revolution that Pep and City created.\nPossession football, with passes through the pitch and end products to finish off the phases of play, is fantastic to watch.\nBut possession football, where the goalkeeper and centre-backs play square passes back and forth, is not fantastic to watch!\nIn my younger days, we were coached to have our first touch forward, and then to play forward to the best technical players we had on the pitch, who usually were the wide players and centre-forwards.\nFootball is not, and should not be conditional - where you play a certain way regardless of the type of players you have got.\nStill, fashions keep on changing. Set-plays have come into fashion with almost every team now trying long throws and in-swinging corners. Teams who were being pressed by opposition forwards at goal-kicks are now playing long, to beat it.\nA certain change of wind direction is taking place, and maybe it has turned back a notch. Even my old assistant, David Kemp, has been in his wardrobe to bring out his old bell-bottom jeans - for those of you reading who are too young to remember, they used to be in fashion in the 1970s.\nAs a manager, I always saw my job was to get results. Maybe substance over style is the direction the Premier League is heading in now?\nTony Pulis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

      "content": "This video can not be played\n'He's making it all about him' - Murphy on Salah\nMohamed Salah's explosive interview has cranked up the pressure on struggling Liverpool head coach Arne Slot as open hostilities broke out at the troubled Premier League champions.\nSalah stopped short of saying \"it's him or me\", but the 33-year-old's claim their relationship has \"broken down\" is a clear challenge to Slot's authority from one of Liverpool's most iconic figures.\n'The Egyptian king', as he is known by Liverpool supporters, did not roll the credits under a glittering career, but it is hard to see how manager and player can be reconciled after such personal and public criticism.\nSlot is already under fierce scrutiny as Liverpool's title defence crumbles. It will now only intensify after Salah chose to air so much dirty laundry in public.\nThe cracks are now wide open after Salah made one of his rare post-match pronouncements that turned into a bitter attack on his head coach and the club.\nIt was a verbal assault that missed no-one as he said: \"It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame.\"\nSalah did not specify who he meant, but he made it crystal clear he no longer has any relationship with Slot.\nFor a club that pride themselves on keeping matters in-house, on stability and calm, Salah's outburst has blown discontent inside Anfield into the open. It is an astonishing show of rebellion from a player who has rightly achieved all-time great status.\nAnd, to make matters worse for Slot and Liverpool, it came after Salah had spent a third successive Premier League game sitting on the bench, this time watching them concede a last-gasp equaliser to draw 3-3 at Leeds United having led 2-0.\nSalah says he has been 'thrown under the bus' by Liverpool\nMohamed Salah says his relationship for Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has \"broken down\"\nSlot has not had to go looking for problems as Liverpool have slumped this season, despite spending almost Â£450m in the summer.\nBut the biggest landed when Salah decided to go public with obvious fury at his treatment.\nSalah uses his words carefully and strategically. At most matches since arriving at Anfield from Roma in 2017, he has declined requests to talk to waiting reporters.\nThis only changes at Salah's behest, like when he stood outside St Mary's in the teeth of Storm Bert last November after scoring twice in a 3-2 win at Southampton to announce he was \"probably more out than in\" at Liverpool as contract negotiations were slow to progress.\nThe impasse was resolved when he signed a two-year deal in April, Salah marking the deal by sitting on a throne in his Liverpool kit at a floodlit Anfield.\nIt was all a far cry from the rancour that was exposed at Elland Road on Saturday night.\nSalah is now more out than in than he has ever been. And if his time at Liverpool ends in such acrimony, it will be a sad farewell.\nIf Salah's words are a challenge to Liverpool and Slot, then it is a battle he is far less likely to win than he was at this time last season.\nIt is understandable that such a proud character would be hurt by being relegated to the bench, such has been his standing at Liverpool.\nSalah has won two Premier League titles, the Champions League, the FA Cup and the EFL Cup at Liverpool, scoring 250 goals. In the Premier League, he has scored 188 goals and provided 88 assists.\nHe is third on Liverpool's all-time list of goalscorers, behind Ian Rush and Roger Hunt.\nThis season, however, Salah has started to look his age. It was not the seismic shock it might once have been when Slot dropped him to the bench for the 2-0 win at West Ham United.\nSalah's form this term has offered a stark contrast to last season, when he seemed driven by a personal mission to bring the league title back to Anfield, which he duly did, scoring 34 goals in 50 starts in all competitions.\nIn this campaign, Salah has made 16 starts, scoring only five times.\nSlot, a head coach searching for answers as the champions struggled, needed to look for solutions and one of those was dropping Salah.\nThe Dutchman also had to explore how he would cope without Salah, not just immediately but in the longer term as he prepares to join Egypt in the Africa Cup of Nations on 15 December.\nSalah's form did not warrant automatic inclusion as it once did at Liverpool. He has been flirting with the bench for some time, although this should never downgrade how he has been a world-class match-winner for so long.\nThe legs have not looked as sprightly as they once did. The goals have not been flowing like the torrent of old. Even greats like Salah cannot defy the passage of time.\nThe next game at Anfield, when Liverpool play Brighton on Saturday, will be played out under the most intense microscope, especially if Slot and Salah are in close proximity.\nSalah is the idol of Liverpool's fans, who have not turned their anger on Slot despite such a drop in form and standards this season.\nLiverpool's next step will also be intriguing, but it is hard to see them sacrificing a manager because of criticism from a player reaching the end of his career, no matter how magnificent that career has been.\nSalah's status and steely character has shown him challenge authority before, such as when he engaged in a furious touchline spat with manager Jurgen Klopp when West Ham scored while he was waiting to come on as a substitute in April 2024.\nOn that occasion, Salah declined to stop in the mixed zone, the area where players can choose to speak to the media, simply saying: \"If I speak, there will be fire.\"\nSalah chose to speak at Elland Road. And that has started an inferno for Slot and Liverpool.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

      "content": "Daniel Farke waving to the crowd after Leeds came back from two goals down to draw with Liverpool\nLeeds United's supporters might have gone into the week with a sense of dread - but they have ended it with renewed hope of staying in the Premier League.\nTheir heroic comeback todraw 3-3against champions Liverpool at Elland Road capped an eight-days spell in which they picked up four points in three of their toughest fixtures.\nSky Sports' Gary Neville summed up Leeds' week perfectly: \"We thought it was a week that could condemn Leeds to the Championship, but it has been a week of hope for Leeds.\"\nWhen under-pressure Daniel Farke's side stepped out at Etihad Stadium to take onManchester Cityon 29 November, they were locked in the bottom three. They fell behind in the first minute.\nCity were expected to go on and post a cricket score after taking a 2-0 lead, but Leeds fought back to level the match - only falling 3-2 to a 91st-minute Phil Foden winner.\nDespite being on a four-game losing run, Leeds optimism was on the rise with a raucous Elland Road waiting for Chelsea on Wednesday.\nLeeds simply proved too much for Enzo Maresca's side and dragged themselves out of the bottom three with a stunning3-1 win.\nTo cap a week to remember, Leeds rallied from 2-0 down against Liverpool to pull level - and after going behind again, found a dramatic late equaliser for 3-3.\nThe pressure may have eased on boss Farke for now after a game he described as \"one of the magic nights at Elland Road\".\nThis video can not be played\nLiverpool let two-goal lead slip to draw 3-3 with Leeds\nFor Farke, the pressure was close to boiling point, with BBC Sport reporting that, according to sources, the process of identifying potential replacements had already begun.\nBut with four points against three of England's top teams in eight days, Farke's job will be safe for now.\nThe Leeds boss was asked by Sky Sports if this was one of his best weeks as a Premier League manager, and said: \"No, one of the most exhausting ones.\n\"If you play against Pep Guardiola, Enzo Maresca and today against Arne Slot and their world-class teams, we know in terms of quality we can't compete with them, so we have to be spot on in tactical terms and try and surprise them sometimes and change the game a little bit.\n\"Yes, it's joyful after the game to get good results but, to be honest, I'm happy that I can spend the weekend with coffee and cake on the sofa.\"\nEven when Leeds lost four in a row, Farke insists he \"never lost faith\".\n\"It's not a question I am even thinking about - because before this week, I was 100% convinced,\" he added. \"I work with these guys every day and I see what it means to them and how united they are and their spirit and togetherness.\n\"It is outstanding. I am a big believer that you get what you invest in and these boys are willing to invest and to present this club in the best possible way.\n\"It's a long road.

      "title": "Are Aston Villa in title hunt - and should Arsenal start to worry?",
      "content": "This video can not be played\nBuendia's late strike ends Arsneal's unbeaten run\nUnai Emery continues to deny Aston Villa are in the title race, even as his old club Arsenal start to look vulnerable at the top of the Premier League.\nVilla's head coach is playing down his current side's chances at a time when their form has become impossible to ignore.\nA dramatic 2-1 win over Arsenal on Saturday moved Villa just three points behind the Gunners, with Manchester City joining both in the top three.\nVilla were in astrikingly similar positiontwo years ago but finished fourth - 23 points behind champions City.\nWith over a third of the Premier League season gone, there is a case to be made that Emery's team should be taken seriously in the title talk this time.\nThey have beaten Arsenal and City at home and have now won nine of their past 10 in the league - seven straight in all competitions - so why would Villa not be in the mix?\nFormer Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy points out one major factor that could count against them.\n\"I don't see them as title contenders, only because of a lack of strength in depth. But their best XI can beat anybody,\" Murphy said.\nDefeat at Villa Park was Arsenal's first loss in 18 games - since going down 1-0 at Liverpool in August - and significantly weakens what had looked a commanding position at the top.\nWith just two wins from their past five Premier League games, Arsenal fans could be starting to get nervous.\nBuendia scores with last kick as Villa beat Arsenal\nThis video can not be played\n'They could still go up another level' - Sutton\nVilla had an expected goals (xG) tally of 2.27 on Saturday, the highest by any team against the Gunners in the Premier League this season, and created five big chances, including the goals for Matty Cash and Buendia.\nThey have have scored 5.45 more goals [22 in total] than their xG [16.55] and conceded 5.83 fewer goals [15] than their xGA [20.83] in the Premier League this season.\nThe latter metric - expected goals against - measures how many goals a team would be expected to concede based on the chances created against them.\nVilla's director of football operations and Emery's trusted lieutenant Damian Vidagany wrote on X after last week's 1-0 win over Wolves that it did not matter if Villa scored from the moon, just that they were getting the points.\nBuendia is now Villa's joint top Premier League scorer with Donyell Malen on four goals - Ollie Watkins, Morgan Rogers and Cash have three - so Villa are also not relying on one player to put the ball in the net.\nThey may be outperforming expected goals figures at both ends of the pitch, but few would begrudge Villa their place near the summit.\nNo team has won more Premier League games since the start of March than Villa.\n\"I am not thinking in it [the title],\" said Emery. \"I know 38 matches is very difficult. We are not a contender. If we were in game 35, perhaps we can speak differently.\n\"Three points gives us a lot of confidence and it gives us a lot of feelings together about how we are doing in this way. The table, we are feeling better about it than two months ago.\n\"[I am] so proud of how we are responding and how we focus on each match, also in Europe. The players are the protagonists.\"\nIt is a long way from Villa's early-season struggles when they failed to win any of their opening six games - including going out to Brentford in the Carabao Cup.\nThey did not score in the Premier League until their sixth game, a 1-1 draw against 10-man Sunderland, but since that point in late September they have won 13 out of 15 games.\nEmery acknowledged their form is the best he could have expected, having been third bottom when leaving the Stadium of Light on 21 September.\nHe said: \"How we are now, I am so proud of the players, how they are taking the challenges we are sending in the dressing room. But it is the reality, the reality is everything we are achieving, but the reality as well is the difficulties we are going to face.\n\"The Premier League is very difficult and our target in 38 matches, we will see it, but of course now we are feeling good and feeling strong and feeling comfortable in the position we are.\"\nIt was just the second time Arsenal had conceded two goals in a game this season\nArsenal have had to contend with injuries to key players this season.\nAgainst Villa, the absences looked to be taking a toll on the Gunners.\nThe treatment room has been busy this season, and players who have spent time out of action have included William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard, Noni Madueke, Cristhian Mosquera and Viktor Gyokeres.\nDefenders Saliba, Mosquera and Gabriel are all unavailable for now, which meant that Jurrien Timber, who usually plays right-back, had to fill in at centre-back at Villa.\nGyokeres, building up his fitness, came on to replace makeshift striker Mikel Merino at Villa Park, but the Â£64m striker failed to make an impact.\nLeandro Trossard has been a standout for Arsenal this season but he too is coming back from injury. Despite scoring the goal that brought Arsenal level after his introduction at half-time, he was substituted himself with four minutes of normal time left on Saturday.\nThis video can not be played\nLevel of consistency has been âincredibleâ despite âpainful lossâ - Arteta\nManager Mikel Arteta was asked in his pre-match press conference whether the Premier League title had become Arsenal's to lose.\nFollowing the loss to Villa, the questions are about whether Arsenal are in poor form.\nThat is the nature of the competitiveness of the Premier League, but there could be signs of worry for Arsenal, even if Arteta expects them to cope with the pressure.\n\"It's five months into the competition and so far we have coped. We are going to have to prove we can cope again, again, again for another six months,\" he said.\n\"That is the level. People who think at this moment we are going to be 10 points clear live in a different world.\n\"That is the league - you go to Old Trafford, you go to St James' Park, you go to Chelsea, you come here, we have been in a lot of difficult grounds.\n\"The result could have been different, the reality is not. We went 18 games unbeaten and still we are there.\n\"That is the level of the league. That is the opportunity that we have ahead of us and that's it. Now it is time to bounce back, they have given me all the right reasons to think we are going to perform at the same level.\n\"We move on. We will learn from today and it will make us a better team.\"\nThis is a shaky spell, with the loss to Villa coming after draws against Chelsea and Sunderland.\nArsenal had an impressive recent win over Tottenham and also a comfortable victory over Brentford, but their once dominant lead has been shredded.\nWith a record of not converting strong starts into trophies, Arsenal fans might well be getting nervous, but the message from the manager is to stay calm.",

      "title": "'He has to score, or we replace him' - Barry finally ends goal drought",
      "content": "This video can not be played\nEverton score three to overcome their former boss Dyche's Forest\nThe smile on Thierno Barry's face said it all.\nIn his 17th game in an Everton shirt, summer signing Barry finally got his first goal for the club in Saturday's 3-0 win against Nottingham Forest.\nThe striker rolled in the Toffees' second after a quick counter-attack and wheeled away to celebrate a moment he might have started fearing would never come.\nThe goal came in the third minute of first-half stoppage time and Barry was still smiling as he headed down the tunnel when the whistle was blown a couple of minutes later.\n\"I was as pleased for the supporters to see him score, as well as for him,\" Everton boss David Moyes said.\n\"I think every Evertonian wanted him to score. I have to say the crowd has given him incredible support, and that gives [players] incredible energy.\n\"His goal was great for him because he has earned it.\"\nBarry scores first Everton goal to help beat Forest\nBarry was brought in by Moyes in the summer from Villarreal, replacing the departed Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\nHis record in Spain's top flight had been decent with 11 goals from 35 games, but the transition to the Premier League has proven difficult.\nPrior to the Forest game he had managed just one shot on target in 16 games - the sort of record that would generally have fans questioning the wisdom of such a player leading their line.\nHowever, Barry is popular among Everton fans for his other contributions, such as his work rate and ability to win headers, the only thing that was missing was goals.\nUntil now.\nHis finish, taken in such a composed manner that you could have been fooled into thinking it was his 15th of the season, seemed to be celebrated that bit more loudly than normal among the home supporters. They no doubt shared Barry's sense of elation and relief.\nThe goal came from the 19th shot he has attempted for Everton and was his first strike since netting for Villarreal against Osasuna in La Liga in May.\nThe 23-year-old also went off to a big standing ovation when he was replaced by Beto - another player who has been struggling for goals - in the second half.\nBut while Barry's all-round play is appreciated by fans, a striker is ultimately judged on goals. The longer his barren run went on, the more the pressure had increased on him.\n\"It's huge for him, and it was coming - it was certainly due,\" Moyes told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"He's got to score, when you're playing centre-forward, otherwise we will find someone to replace him.\"\nThere are some things that are meant to just go together - bread and butter, fish and chips and, clearly, Everton and David Moyes.\nThe 62-year-old returned for his second spell at the club in January, replacing the man who now leads Forest - Sean Dyche.\nSince coming back, Moyes has turned Everton from the relegation battlers they have been in recent seasons to a side now contending for European football.\nWith 15 victories from 36 games, Moyes has a win percentage that is similar to his first spell (41.67% now compared to 42.08%), suggesting he has effectively picked up from where he left off when he departed for Manchester United 12 years ago.\nBut the Scot has been a manager long enough to know that now is not the time to get carried away over what Everton could potentially achieve this season.\n\"I want to be positive, I want to say we will try and attempt to get close to Europe,\" he said.\n\"We are not a side yet who will win games all the time, but we are making good progress.\"\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

      "content": "Arsenal maintained their position near the top of the Premier League table with a disciplined 2–1 win over Tottenham in a match defined more by structure than spectacle. While both sides produced moments of quality in transition, the contest largely hinged on Arsenal’s ability to apply a controlled mid-block that disrupted Spurs' buildup patterns.\n\nMikel Arteta’s side set the tone early with a focus on directing Tottenham’s possession wide. Declan Rice operated as the primary stabilizer, stepping into passing lanes while ensuring numerical security behind the ball. This approach limited Spurs’ ability to find James Maddison between the lines, forcing Ange Postecoglou’s team into longer, riskier vertical passes.\n\nArsenal’s opener came in the 27th minute through Bukayo Saka, who finished a well-worked sequence initiated by Martin Ødegaard’s diagonal switch. The move highlighted Arsenal’s desire to overload one side before quickly exploiting isolation on the opposite flank.\n\nTottenham equalized shortly after halftime via Son Heung-min, capitalizing on a rare lapse when Gabriel failed to clear a loose ball. The goal briefly shifted momentum, but Arsenal regained control through sustained pressure and second-ball recoveries. Their match-winner came in the 72nd minute after a short-corner routine, with Ben White rising to head home at the near post.\n\nSpurs struggled for fluidity in the final phase, particularly after losing Rodrigo Bentancur to a suspected groin problem. His absence reduced Tottenham’s ability to circulate possession under pressure, resulting in turnovers that allowed Arsenal to manage territory effectively.\n\nPost-match, Arteta praised his side’s maturity, noting their improved game management compared to previous derbies.

      "content": "Liverpool secured a 2–0 victory over Brighton at Anfield, but the win was overshadowed by news that Alexis Mac Allister will be sidelined for at least four weeks with an ankle sprain. The Argentine has been central to Liverpool’s progress under Arne Slot this season, and his absence raises questions about how the team will manage its midfield balance.\n\nSlot has relied on Mac Allister as the connector between Liverpool’s buildup and final-third actions. His ability to receive under pressure and initiate quick combinations has helped Liverpool dominate possession against compact defenses. Without him, the responsibility may shift to Dominik Szoboszlai or Ryan Gravenberch, though neither possesses the same defensive instincts.\n\nAgainst Brighton, Liverpool showcased depth in other areas. Curtis Jones delivered a standout performance, scoring the opener with a driven low shot from outside the box. His energy contributed significantly to Liverpool’s ability to sustain pressure after turnovers.\n\nBrighton threatened intermittently through Joao Pedro and Simon Adingra, but Liverpool’s high press limited their ability to progress centrally. Virgil van Dijk marshaled the back line with composure, and the visitors struggled to generate clear scoring opportunities.\n\nSlot’s side doubled their lead in the 70th minute through Cody Gakpo, who finished a flowing counterattack initiated by Trent Alexander-Arnold. The right-back’s hybrid role continues to fuel Liverpool’s transitions, though his defensive positioning remains a topic of debate.\n\nPost-match, Slot acknowledged the significance of Mac Allister’s injury but expressed confidence in the squad’s adaptability. He also hinted that January reinforcements could be considered if recovery timelines worsen.\n\nLiverpool’s victory keeps them firmly in the title race, but the coming fixtures—including meetings with Chelsea and Manchester City—will test the durability of Slot’s system without one of its most important midfield anchors.",

The three points in the Champions League not only give Slot a much-needed reprieve from the noise surrounding him in a week where he has been engulfed in a public falling out with Mohamed Salah, but they have also strengthened his side's position in Europe as they seek qualification to the knockout rounds, with Liverpool climbing into the top eight in the league phase. Carragher said on CBS: \"I was so desperate for Liverpool to win tonight, as I am every time they play, but more so for the manager for what he's been through over the last few days. \"I don't know him that well, have any real relationship with him, but he's the Liverpool manager. \"We know what's gone on and what was really telling was the supporters chanting his name in the first half when it was 0-0… they're right behind their manager, even more so on the back of that result. \"It was a massive result, it's a tough place to go and Liverpool needed that on the back of losing their last game at home in the Champions League to PSV. \"I'm happy for him more than anything. It's been tough all season for him. As a manager, he has to do better in terms of getting more results with the squad of players he's got, but that's a huge result for him and the club. Slot said: \"I think it was really hard for the players to concede in the last minute against Leeds, where, in my opinion, we already played a very good game. We hardly conceded a chance. In the last four games in general, we've hardly conceded a chance. \"To go away there with three goals conceded and a draw was really hard to take. And then that was already emotional. Then what happened afterwards was emotional, I think as well. It cost maybe a little bit of energy. Fourth game in 10 days, 13 outfield players available that have Premier League or Champions League experience, that shows you the resilience of these players. \"Then of course there's a lot of things being said, and I think that always affects a team a little bit as well. If you've been in the dressing room, you know, OK, it's about a player with the manager or with the club, but that normally affects players a bit as well, especially because he's so good, so, so, so influential for the club and for the players. So it's never nice, I think, to see something happen like this to one of their team-mates. \"All the focus should be on that tonight, and I can fully understand if I go Friday again into the press conference that all questions will be about Mo, but I think these players deserve it now that we speak about them.\"\nSlot did question whether Salah understands that he has made a mistake with his recent comments and suggested that it is up to a player to initiate a conversation with him to get back into the Liverpool team. Slot clarified his comments in the press conference, suggesting he wasn't hinting that Salah should make first move. \"Of course there's a lot of things being said, and I think that always affects a team a little bit as well,\"Slot said post-match to Amazon Prime. \"If you've been in the dressing room you know it's about a player with the manager or with the club, but that normally affects players a bit as well, especially because he's so good and so influential. \"It's never nice to see something like this happen to one of your team-mates. \"Everyone makes mistakes in life, so the first thing should be, does the player think he's made a mistake as well? \"Then the next question is, should the initiative come from me or from him?

      "content": "A VAR-plagued evening at the San Siro eventually fell the way of Liverpool as Arne Slot's men delivered a much-needed win over Inter Milan in the Champions League. The much-maligned Ibrahima Konate thought he had silenced his critics as he nodded home from close range in the first half, only for his effort to be ruled out for handball after a lengthy VAR check. Having initially suffered at its hands, Liverpool would eventually benefit from VAR as the visitors were handed a penalty on review as Florian Wirtz went down in the Inter area, with Dominik Szoboszlai smashing home the resulting 88th-minute spot kick. The three points not only gives Slot a much needed reprieve from the noise surrounding him in a week where he has been engulfed in a public falling out with Mohamed Salah, but they have also strengthened his side's position in Europe as they seek qualification to the knockout rounds, with Liverpool climbing into the top eight in the league phase. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nLiverpool were without Mohamed Salah after he was left out of the travelling squad for the trip to the San Siro. Arne Slot opted to start both Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak for just the second time this season, the first being the 5-1 win over Frankfurt\nMuch of the talk before the game centred around the absence of Salah, who was left out of the travelling squad after claiming to have been \"thrown under the bus\" during the Reds' recent poor run of form. The embattled Slot was forced to make a change without the Egyptian in his squad, with a self-perceived lack of wingers forcing him to start both Ekitike and Alexander Isak up top. It was the visitors though who looked the more positive against last season's Champions League finalists. The pressure seemed to have paid off as Konate finished from close range from a scrappy corner. Live Champions League table\nChampions League fixtures\nGot Sky? Watch now on the Sky Sports app\nNot got Sky? Get instant access with no contract\nEkitike had risen above Alessandro Bastoni, but the contact with his initial header saw the ball drop down onto his arm before Konate reacted quickest to beat Yann Sommer to the ball and score. However, after a five-minute VAR review, referee Felix Zwayer chalked the goal off as a result of the deflection off Ekitike's arm. The game lacked any real quality from that point on, with Lautaro Martinez and Conor Bradley coming closest for either side. The deadlock would eventually be broken though, as VAR had its say again. Substitute Wirtz seemed to go down softly after a pull of the shirt by Bastoni, with play initially being waved on. Zwayer would again overturn his original decision, allowing Szoboszlai to convert from 12 yards to the relief of the traveling Liverpool support. The result means that Liverpool climb up to eighth in the Champions League league phase, level on points with Inter who sit fifth after six games. Speaking toAmazon Primepost-match, Arne Slot was quick to try and shift the focus on his players, but when probed on whether he could reconcile with the ousted Salah, questioned whether the player understood if he had made a mistake. \"Of course there's a lot of things being said, and I think that always affects a team a little bit as well,\" Slot said. \"If you've been in the dressing room you know it's about a player with the manager or with the club, but that normally affects players a bit as well, especially because he's so good and so influential. \"It's never nice to see something like this happen to one of your team-mates. \"All the focus should be on that tonight.

Now, that's another question to answer. But as I said, the focus for tonight should be about, for example, Virgil, because the fans are singing for him.\"\nLiverpoolcaptainVirgil van Dijkspeaking withAmazon Prime:\n\"There's obviously so much noise from the outside world, which is absolutely normal, especially if you don't perform, especially under the circumstances, then it's absolutely deserved. \"It's down to us to perform on the pitch, because that's the only thing we can control. We want to improve, we want to be consistent, we want to win games. \"It's difficult, but it's a collectively difficult situation that we're all in. Obviously, between Mo and the club, things are going on. There are consequences, he's not here today to help us try to get the three points. That's the reality, but I don't think anything changes in terms of our focus, our determination to get results for the football club. \"I don't think I'm the one to speak about if someone has to apologise for anything. I think it's him airing his feelings over the last couple of days, and that's something that the club has to deal with. \"The reality also is that Mo is going to Africa on the weekend. That is also true. There's an urgency. So you don't have a lot of time. The thing is, I've known Mo for such a long time. We are good friends, we've been through highs and lows. He's been a big part of the success I've had at the club in my football career. I've been a big part of his success.\"\nLiverpool'sAndy Robertsonspeaking withAmazon Prime:\n\"The handball, for me, if it takes seven or eight minutes to come to a decision, you have to stick with the on-field decision. \"If it takes that long for the VAR to make a decision you have to stick to what the decision is. The penalty looked soft but anywhere else on the pitch it gets given.\"\nOn Mohamed Salah:\n\"It's a tough situation. For me, he's one of the greatest players to play for this club.

      "title": "Chelsea youngsters must show steel or winless run will continue after damaging Champions League defeat at Atalanta",
      "content": "Chelsea’s soft underbelly was exposed again in defeat at Atalanta - they must toughen up or expect their four-game winless run to continue. Any talk of challenging for the Premier League title can be dismissed if Enzo Maresca's young side doesn't start showing some steel. Their humbling defeat at Leeds was a wake-up call, but they showed little learning from that on Tuesday night. Not for 44 games in the Champions League had Chelsea lost after scoring the opening goal, and it was the first time since 2005 that they were beaten away from home after leading at half-time. Atalanta pressed and harried Chelsea, but this should not have come as a surprise. Not only is it how the Serie A club operate on home turf, but as a fellow Italian and friend of Atalanta boss Raffaele Palladino, Maresca would have known exactly what was coming. Five changes from the weekend's draw against Bournemouth did not help. Some were forced through injury or rest, others were not. Rotation is key with such a heavy schedule, but at the moment, it is working against rather than for them, particularly at the back. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nMaresca defended the changes. \"If you see the five changes that we did compared to Bournemouth, it's different,\" he said. \"But we had eight, nine players that are the same as against Barcelona, Arsenal, Tottenham and Wolves. The ones that they play tonight are the ones that they are playing in almost all the games.\"\nTheir rhythm in defence was broken further when Trevoh Chalobah was substituted at half-time for Wesley Fofana, who was later forced off with injury. \"It was a little bit planned because Trev is playing every game,\" said Maresca, but it was also a risk-averse decision. Gianluca Scamacca peeled away too easily for his header, while Marc Cucurella, concerned by the overlapping run of Davide Zappacosta, backed off while waiting for support from Benoit Badiashile, which invited Charles De Ketelaere to shoot and score. \"Mostly if the full-back comes [out], I try to give [the ball] to the wingback,\" said the goalscorer. \"They kept dropping back so I shot.\" Chelsea made a rod for their own back. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nChelsea's brightest player was 19-year-old Josh Acheampong, who made a series of superb tackles and blocks to keep the Blues in the game. Maresca said he regretted not playing the teenager against Leeds, but would have been delighted with his showing in Italy. Acheampong has the required grit. Chelsea's drop off has been concerning since title contender talk began following their spirited draw against Arsenal and the dismantling of Barcelona. They were too easily beaten by Leeds, who had taken lessons from their previous match against Manchester City and used them to full effect. Bournemouth too, themselves struggling for form, never looked to be in danger of losing to Chelsea. Maresca's side has started to look like what they should be: a naive, inexperienced group of talented youngsters. Their game management and mentality has to improve. Some may also point to the Club World Cup exertions over the summer starting to take their toll, giving the Blues an extended season and a short pre-season. Maresca said: \"After the first goal, we lost a little bit of control of the game. Also, we are playing every two days. We look like we struggle a little bit.\"\nYet their hopes of avoiding a Champions League play-off game and a further fixture pile-up have taken a huge hit with the defeat in Italy. \"If we want to try to finish top eight, we need to win both,\" said Maresca of their final matches against Pafos and Napoli. The next target for this team is consistency, in both performances and results. The Premier League and Champions League tables are incredibly tight, and every point counts. They have not learned how to grind out a result. It does not get easier with a visit of Everton this weekend. They have won four of their last five Premier League games, vastly improved under David Moyes and will not have a midweek game to contend with. There will be some returns and likely more rotation, but it is the wrong time of year to start having a blip. Chelsea need to rediscover their winning touch and soon. It starts with growing up.",

The Serie A side have lost only once at home this season, while Enzo Maresca's side are yet to win away in Europe, having now lost twice and drawn once.

Reece James' fizzing cross was finished by Joao Pedro, but the offside flag immediately went up. The forward wagged his finger in disagreement - and he was right. VAR stepped in and found both James and Joao Pedro were onside, and the goal was given. Atalanta had not scored in the first half of a European game this season, and while they couldn't end that particular run they did find the net shortly after half-time - but not before James missed a huge chance to double Chelsea's lead.

It is the second game in a row the Belgian has registered two goal involvements, with Atalanta now up to third in the Champions League table.

Richarlison and Kudus both went close in the early stages - with the former denied from point-blank range in the first minute - before the breakthrough arrived when Cristian Romero's header from a corner cannoned off Zima to give them a deserved lead. Tottenham's opening goal, a David Zima own goal, was their 100th in the UEFA Champions League in what was their 59th match in the competition. It was another fast start after the restart which led to the second goal of the evening. Pedro Porro was caught late inside the box by Youssoupha Sanyang, attempting to block the full-back's cross, with Kudus then stepping up with confidence to convert from the spot.

A win in their final league-phase fixture next week against OH Leuven could be enough to secure an automatic route into the knockout stages, but for now Renee Slegers' side move up to sixth, providing a lifeline. When Mead dropped her shoulder in the box to fire home the opener with 10 minutes on the clock, there was a feeling among those in attendance that Arsenal were chasing a significant margin. Moments prior to Mead's deflected finish, she had been denied by Anna Knol who headed clear her earlier strike off the line as the Gunners began their domination. The reigning champions limited the away side to a single shot on target, a tame Jaimy Ravensbergen header in the second half and just two shots in total. Arsenal themselves created a host of opportunities with 15 efforts in total, five of which were on target. Alessia Russo, who came into the game on a run of 11 goals in 10 Champions League games, failed to find the net but came close to doubling Arsenal's advantage late on when her header rattled the bar. A narrow lead meant that England skipper, Leah Williamson, who returned to the bench having been out of action since the Euros final in June, wasn't risked by boss Renee Slegers. Got Sky?

We could have maybe took a few more risks in the final third. We had very good chances today and didn't put some of them in the back of the net which is very frustrating. \"They [Twente] are a hard-working side. They came out really well, which we knew they would, settled down and had some good patterns of play. It's just the ruthlessness in front of goal we were lacking a bit today.\"\nOn her winning goal:\"We obviously want to score more goals. We had chances to do that. We weren't ruthless enough in front of goal today. When you have chances, you have to score. I had my chance and got my goal. Happy it went in this time.\"\nOn top four chances:\"That's the aim. We've got to put three points on the table next week. We had an up-and-down campaign last time, you can turn these things around. We just want to finish the Champions League year with a win and put ourselves in a very good position moving forward. ArsenalbossRenee Slegers:\n\"I think we dominated. When you look at it we've been really close in a lot of games. We've let ourselves down in a few moments, Bayern Munich first half was really good, second half we let ourselves down. We know we can compete, it's just putting it together and getting those results over the line. \"We got a goal in the first half. I think we did some quite good things in the first half, in the way we set up and the movements we created, and the spaces we created in the box. We said after Liverpool that we want to keep our foot on the gas and want to go for a second. \"It was hard today. I think the rhythm in the second half was broken down a little bit with everything that they tried to do to manage the game. It broke down at times for us. I think there was quite a lot of set-pieces and referee decisions, so we never really got into that nice flow and rhythm to stack attacks. But we did stack set-pieces. \"We were chasing that second one but for as long as it's 1-0, you know that your opponent always can get one chance. But I think in the end we managed that well. I'm really happy for the team and for Anneke to have the clean sheet today. \"I'm very pleased and I think we adjusted well. They, of course, started to stack numbers and went more direct from goal-kicks in those last couple of minutes. I think the team did well on working on those first and second balls in those moments.

Until the Canadian's equaliser, Coventry were in complete control, with the help of Liam Lindsay's red card for dragging back Haji Wright, and took the lead after Andrew Hughes' deflected a shot into his own net. For large parts of the first half, Wright was the only threat for either side, and almost everything he attempted was managed well by Preston. The American was found hurrying behind Preston's defence and, after his touch shifted him wide, it allowed Daniel Iversen to deny him. The Lancashire club were forced to defend for the majority of the half, but did look threatening in the rare flurry forward. Lewis Dobbin turned into space but floated his shot just over the bar. It was only seven minutes after Wright's first effort that he was found in a similar position. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nAs half-time approached, he fired a header over from close range, but with six minutes until the break he was rushing behind Preston's defence before being dragged to the ground by Lindsay, who saw red for the challenge. With the man advantage, Coventry's pressure intensified, with Wright prodding a shot that Iversen thwarted again three minutes into the second half. And when the Championship leaders did break through Preston's defence in the second half, poor finishing let them down with Victor Torp scuffing his shot from just inside the box. Preston suffered for almost all the game but, 15 minutes after the break, Harrison Armstrong hit a looping volley over his head that forced Carl Rushworth into tapping it over the bar. But that was a rare test for Coventry's defence, as Iversen was again called into action and again responded heroically, diving across goal to parry away Torp's close-ranged effort. After 70 minutes, Coventry finally found their breakthrough via a huge stroke of luck. Rudoni collected the ball and hit a shot that heavily deflected off Hughes to wrongfoot Iversen and rolled in. Instead of kicking on from the goal, they were pegged back six minutes later when Jebbison poked Pol Valentin's cross past Rushworth to dent their lead at the top of the Championship and keep Preston two points into the play-off positions. Preston's Paul Heckingbottom:\n\"We have been resilient all season, but I felt that when they scored we were the ones that looked more threatening. \"They were going for it in the final couple of minutes, but everyone to a man was really committed to getting the point that we needed. \"The sending-off sort of zoned us in, because we knew what we had to do to win the game. \"I think nothing really changed in principle throughout the game, the principles are the same. We just needed to make a problem in their box and it worked really well for us. \"I felt we were really positives at time, and the changes we made gave us a real lift at times. \"This league is going to be crazy this season, it always is but this season more than any is going to be. \"I think today shows that we have gone up a place with a point. A point normally gets you nowhere but today was more than that point. \"We showed what we are really about, the determination and the spirit against a really good side and we got what we deserved.\"\nCoventry's Frank Lampard:\n\"I am the first one to say that when we were 10 points clear and people don't go 10 points clear in December and win this league. \"There is a lot to be done and it is important that the players stay level-headed and it is one game in which we played pretty well, and one moment was costly. \"I said to the players it shouldn't feel like a loss but it does because of the standards and the way that we play. \"We clearly should have won the game.

The Wales international swept home a superb effort from 20 yards in the 78th minute for the only goal of a tight content between two clubs who have been in poor recent form. But following Swansea's victory over Oxford last weekend, it means new boss Vitor Matos has delivered back-to-back league victories for the first time since April. The win has lifted Swansea six points clear of the relegation zone but Pompey remain in the bottom three and have won just once in their last 10 matches. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nBoth clubs were in search of points to ease relegation fears, with Portsmouth's need more pressing as they began the night in 22nd position with Swansea just above the drop zone one place above the visitors. It was frenetic but untidy for most of the first half with neither side capable of taking any of the few chances that came their way. Swansea pressed the harder and had the clearer opportunities, but Eom Ji-Sung slid an early shot wide before both Adam Idah and Brazilian Ronald were unable to get a touch to a tempting cross from Ethan Galbraith. Swansea centre-back Cameron Burgess flicked a header just over the bar from a corner, before Idah did well to create an opening for Melker Widell. The Swedish midfielder pivoted neatly in the penalty area but his snapshot was met with a sharp save from Portsmouth keeper Nicolas Schmid. It remained goalless at the break and neither side were able to alter the picture in the opening period after the restart. Josh Murphy - cheerily booed by Swansea fans for being a former Cardiff player - almost gave the home fans something else to be aggrieved with but his shot from the left side of the penalty box was turned around the post from Vigouroux. It was a signal that although Pompey were spending most of the game on the back foot, they remained a threat on the counter-attack. Swansea's recently appointed head coach Matos made a number of changes on the hour mark and was almost rewarded when substitute Zan Vipotnik hit the side-netting from a narrow angle on the right just moments after coming on. With pressure on the Portsmouth goal building, the deserved breakthrough finally arrived for Swansea in the 78th minute through Cullen. Zeidane Inoussa did the work on the left flank and when Malick Yalcouye mis-controlled it gave Cullen just enough space to swipe home a curling shot from the edge of the box. Swansea's Vitor Matos:\n\"The effort the team put in, especially the midfielders, was unbelievable. \"That allowed us to stay competitive during the game and then it's about the details - like a brilliant shot from Liam again, which gave us a good goal. \"More important than back-to-back wins are the clean sheets. We kept that another clean sheet at home and this is the kind of mentality, the understanding, that means we can start building things from the defensive way. \"We know that we need to keep improving and that there's a lot of things to come still. So, it's another step, another game and in three days we play again.\"\nPortsmouth's John Mousinho:\n\"The performance was really solid and the effort levels were there, we just switched off for the goal and didn't get the press right. \"There was nothing in the game, but what is frustrating is that we got into some really good areas and just did not put Swansea under enough pressure. \"When we get into good areas we either don't shoot or the ball doesn't come into the area quick enough. With the players we have at the top of the pitch, we definitely have to be better. \"The major frustration for me was the goal. Entries by 3pm Saturday.",

Championship top scorer Adam Armstrong scored twice before half-time to take his tally to 11 after Leo Scienza set the hosts on their way with an early goal. The Baggies put up a second-half fight through goals from Karlan Grant and Nathaniel Phillips and went close to a late leveller but have now lost their last seven away games. With such a dismal record on the road, Southampton was not the trip Ryan Mason would have wanted to be making on a windswept Tuesday in December. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nEckert had won all of his three home games in charge of the Saints and they tore into Mason's side. Armstrong had already stung the palms of Joe Wildsmith before Saints led in the 12th minute through Scienza. The goal was made by former Albion winger Tom Fellows, who drove through the heart of midfield from within his own half before feeding Scienza to finish clinically into the far corner. A mistake from West Brom's Krystian Bielik which allowed Armstrong to steal possession and finish emphatically past Wildsmith. Mason's side were looking shellshocked but did carve out a rare chance when Grant found some space down the left and curled the ball beyond the far post. Saints threatened each time they went forward and more great work from Scienza set up Caspar Jander to shoot, but his effort flew over. It seemed only a matter of time before Saints scored again, and Armstrong added his seventh goal in six games as he latched on to Finn Azaz's disguised pass to again finish into the far corner. The small group of travelling supporters booed their side off at half-time. The pace of the game slowed in the second period as Southampton dominated possession and the Baggies sat behind the ball. Grant was West Brom's best player and scored just after the hour mark as he cut in from the left and struck low into the far corner to give the away side hope. Ten minutes from time, Mason's side threatened from successive corners, with Gavin Bazunu saving brilliantly from Bielik and Ryan Manning clearing Jayson Molumby's effort off the line. But with four minutes left Phillips nodded in from Mikey Johnston's corner to ensure a nervy ending for the home side. Samuel Iling-Junior missed a glorious chance to equalise at the death when he somehow put Johnston's cross wide of the post and Saints survived. Southampton's Tonda Eckert:\n\"The very positive thing is that if you have those home games and they become tight towards the end, that you also have a crowd that can bring the game over the line for you. \"I honestly want to thank everyone who came out to St Mary's today because that made a hell of a difference. \"If we have come to the point that we try to look for bits, even though we win, I think that we've come quite to a good state. \"At the same time, obviously we struggled a little bit more in the second half than in the last two games, I think for different reasons. That is definitely something that we're going to address.\"\nWest Brom's Ryan Mason:\n\"I don't read the press so in terms of rumours, it's irrelevant. I'm not a coach, I'm not a manager, I'm not a person who makes excuses in life. \"My job is to turn up every day and try and change the situation, away from home especially. \"The squad is certainly good enough to be in a better position than we are in the league. \"The way we lost the game is difficult to accept. There were some individual mistakes and that can happen, but I think a lack of belief is something which upsets me more. \"I probably believe in this group more than they believe in themselves at the minute. But of course, I understand football, I'm not stupid. Entries by 3pm Saturday.",

      "content": "Sheffield United's four-match winning run came to an end as they were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Norwich. The hosts - whose starting line-up featured eight changes from the weekend due to \"illness and injuries\" - took the lead early in the second half with a goal from Danny Ings. Norwich, though, hit back to equalise with Djibril Soumare scoring an own goal. There were chances at either end during a lively first half, with both keepers called into action. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nIngs headed over an open goal while Norwich keeper Vladan Kovacevic kept out efforts from Tom Cannon and Harrison Burrows. Josh Sargent went desperately close to putting the visitors ahead with an overhead kick which was headed off the line by Ings after the ball remained in play following Michael Cooper's save from Oscar Schwartau. Cooper also pulled off saves from Kellen Fisher and Sargent during the first 45 minutes after seeing an early shot from Jacob Wright go wide of his right-hand post. United's goal came in the 50th minute when Tahith Chong checked back on the right-hand byline inside the area to shrug off Tony Springett and then played a low ball across the face of goal which was tapped in by Ings. Making his 12th appearance for the Blades, it was the striker's first goal for the club. A defensive lapse led to the equalising goal with the defenders failing to clear the danger before Jovon Makama's shot was turned into his own net by Soumare. Late in the game, United's Patrick Bamford threatened to get on the end of a ball played into the area by fellow substitute Gus Hamer while Tyrese Campbell put a far-post effort wide. Another substitute, Andre Brooks, also posed problems down the right-hand side but it was Norwich who had the best chance to snatch victory in time added on. With United throwing players forward, substitute Amankwah Forson won possession in his own half and made a surging run through the middle, finding himself through on goal, but his low shot was touched wide by Cooper. Forson was left holding his head in frustration, with the final whistle blown shortly afterwards. Sheffield United's Chris Wilder:\n\"I've got to say, personally for myself and the coaches, it's possibly one of the most challenging last 24-48 hours that we've had. Players dropping out like flies and stuff like that. \"I think you always understand as a manager, every decision you make is put under the spotlight. One of those decisions that I made today for that team selection wasn't a tactical one, it was a physical situation. \"Should have won it I think, in my opinion. But you've got to give the opposition credit. They started brighter than us. \"We started to get back in the game and created some good chances, got ourselves in front. I can't fault the players' attitude, can't really fault the players' application in trying to win the game. \"We'd love to have kept the run going, the winning run, but we haven't. We've got to reset and go again Friday (against West Brom) and see who's available.\"\nNorwich's Philippe Clement:\n\"If you see how the squad is stretched for the moment and you need to play players out of position, players coming in, players coming out of injury. I'm really proud what the team showed today. \"So the important thing is, after three weeks together, you see that everybody knows the basics of their job, what to do, and that they did today. \"A lot of good stuff together as a team, in organisation, but also on the ball. We've seen a team against a good opponent and we had a lot of good moments on the ball, creating the right spaces, creating good chances also. \"And then it's disappointing. It's two away games in a row that we're alone in front of the goalkeeper - that's the best chance you can have in football - that we don't score those because then these weeks could have been totally different than they are now. \"The belief is there. It's clear for everybody. The team is working really hard, giving their all in every game. Entries by 3pm Saturday.",

      "title": "Watford vs Sheffield Wednesday; Sky Bet Championship",
      "content": "Substitute Vivaldo Semedo's equaliser in the seventh minute of stoppage time denied Sheffield Wednesday a second Championship win of the season. Charlie McNeill's third goal in two games appeared to have handed rock-bottom Wednesday a rare bit of cheer in a difficult campaign. But just when wasteful Watford, who missed a penalty through skipper Imran Louza, seemed to have run out of ideas, Semedo squeezed a volley from Mamadou Doumbia's cross under goalkeeper Pierce Charles to salvage a point. Struggling Wednesday were relieved not to fall behind inside five minutes when Giorgi Chakvetadze strike was too close to goalkeeper Charles from Othmane Maamma's low centre. But from their first meaningful excursion into Watford territory, the Owls went ahead after 17 minutes. Max Alleyne's poor headed clearance from Yan Valery's cross fell straight to McNeill and crisp left-foot shot extended the Hornets' dismal sequence of just one clean sheet since April. It was also the eighth time in 11 home games this season that Watford have conceded the first goal. Louza placed his shot just the wrong side of a post from fellow Moroccan Maamma's pass, before the Golden Ball winner at the Under-20 World Cup was guilty of a glaring miss from six yards. With loyal veteran Barry Bannan marshalling the Owls' resistance, Henrik Pedersen's men somehow held out until the break. As Watford laid siege to the visitors' goal, hapless referee Dean Whitestone's inadvertent body-check on Marc Bola almost set up a Wednesday breakaway, and the visitors were upset when the experienced official stopped play for a drop-ball. Whitestone was the centre of attention again when Louza's penalty, awarded for a foul on Bola by substitute Sean Fusire, rattled the crossbar and Edo Kayembe steered home the rebound. But Kayembe was penalised for encroaching and Watford's night of missed opportunities reached a frustrating new low. Louza did his best to atone for his spot-kick miss, twice extending Charles from long range, and Wednesday looked like holding out until Semedo's second goal of the season broke the 1,578 travelling fans' hearts. Watford's Javi Gracia:\n\"We had good chances, many chances, but (converting them) is something we're not doing well in the last games. \"It's difficult to win games when you don't take them but, for me, it's not just about us taking clear-cut chances - it's about falling behind again and it's something we need to fix. \"We made it difficult for ourselves when we concede from the first shot on our goal. \"It's another point for us but it's not enough. We showed character to fight to the end but I'm disappointed. We have the youngest squad in the Championship and we have to learn from these experiences fast. \"I would like to give value to the opponent because they have had a difficult season and they competed really well tonight. \"But we had an xG of 2.7 goals, so a point is not enough. We needed to take the points but we were conceding easy goals, most goals, in the first half of too many games and we have to fix it.\"\nSheffield Wednesday's Henrik Pedersen:\n\"The first feeling is of disappointment because we were so close - but I'm also very proud because we gave everything and played with a fantastic togetherness. \"The tactical discipline and courage of our players was a big step forward. We know about Watford's speed and power going forward in transition and how we played in the second half was amazing. \"The boys were all disappointed in the dressing room afterwards, but we asked the team for commitment, intensity, discipline and togetherness and they were very, very strong. The players have done a fantastic job and they have grown a lot as a team. Entries by 3pm Saturday.",

      "title": "Inter Milan vs Liverpool; UEFA Champions League",
      "content": "A VAR-plagued evening at the San Siro eventually fell the way of Liverpool as Arne Slot's men delivered a much-needed win over Inter Milan in the Champions League. The much-maligned Ibrahima Konate thought he had silenced his critics as he nodded home from close range in the first half, only for his effort to be ruled out for handball after a lengthy VAR check. Having initially suffered at its hands, Liverpool would eventually benefit from VAR as the visitors were handed a penalty on review as Florian Wirtz went down in the Inter area, with Dominik Szoboszlai smashing home the resulting 88th-minute spot kick. The three points not only gives Slot a much needed reprieve from the noise surrounding him in a week where he has been engulfed in a public falling out with Mohamed Salah, but they have also strengthened his side's position in Europe as they seek qualification to the knockout rounds, with Liverpool climbing into the top eight in the league phase. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nLiverpool were without Mohamed Salah after he was left out of the travelling squad for the trip to the San Siro. Arne Slot opted to start both Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak for just the second time this season, the first being the 5-1 win over Frankfurt\nMuch of the talk before the game centred around the absence of Salah, who was left out of the travelling squad after claiming to have been \"thrown under the bus\" during the Reds' recent poor run of form. The embattled Slot was forced to make a change without the Egyptian in his squad, with a self-perceived lack of wingers forcing him to start both Ekitike and Alexander Isak up top. It was the visitors though who looked the more positive against last season's Champions League finalists. The pressure seemed to have paid off as Konate finished from close range from a scrappy corner. Live Champions League table\nChampions League fixtures\nGot Sky? Watch now on the Sky Sports app\nNot got Sky? Get instant access with no contract\nEkitike had risen above Alessandro Bastoni, but the contact with his initial header saw the ball drop down onto his arm before Konate reacted quickest to beat Yann Sommer to the ball and score. However, after a five-minute VAR review, referee Felix Zwayer chalked the goal off as a result of the deflection off Ekitike's arm. The game lacked any real quality from that point on, with Lautaro Martinez and Conor Bradley coming closest for either side. The deadlock would eventually be broken though, as VAR had its say again. Substitute Wirtz seemed to go down softly after a pull of the shirt by Bastoni, with play initially being waved on. Zwayer would again overturn his original decision, allowing Szoboszlai to convert from 12 yards to the relief of the traveling Liverpool support. The result means that Liverpool climb up to eighth in the Champions League league phase, level on points with Inter who sit fifth after six games. Speaking toAmazon Primepost-match, Arne Slot was quick to try and shift the focus on his players, but when probed on whether he could reconcile with the ousted Salah, questioned whether the player understood if he had made a mistake. \"Of course there's a lot of things being said, and I think that always affects a team a little bit as well,\" Slot said. \"If you've been in the dressing room you know it's about a player with the manager or with the club, but that normally affects players a bit as well, especially because he's so good and so influential. \"It's never nice to see something like this happen to one of your team-mates. \"All the focus should be on that tonight. I can fully understand if I go on Friday into the press conference that all questions are about Mo, but I think these players deserve it that now we speak about them. \"Everyone makes mistakes in life, so the first thing should be: does the player think he's made a mistake as well? \"Then the next question is, should the initiative come from me or from him? Now, that's another question to answer. But as I said, the focus for tonight should be about, for example, Virgil, because the fans are singing for him.\"\nLiverpoolcaptainVirgil van Dijkspeaking withAmazon Prime:\n\"There's obviously so much noise from the outside world, which is absolutely normal, especially if you don't perform, especially under the circumstances, then it's absolutely deserved. \"It's down to us to perform on the pitch, because that's the only thing we can control. We want to improve, we want to be consistent, we want to win games. \"It's difficult, but it's a collectively difficult situation that we're all in. Obviously, between Mo and the club, things are going on. There are consequences, he's not here today to help us try to get the three points. That's the reality, but I don't think anything changes in terms of our focus, our determination to get results for the football club. \"I don't think I'm the one to speak about if someone has to apologise for anything. I think it's him airing his feelings over the last couple of days, and that's something that the club has to deal with. \"The reality also is that Mo is going to Africa on the weekend. That is also true. There's an urgency. So you don't have a lot of time. The thing is, I've known Mo for such a long time. We are good friends, we've been through highs and lows. He's been a big part of the success I've had at the club in my football career. I've been a big part of his success.\"\nLiverpool'sAndy Robertsonspeaking withAmazon Prime:\n\"The handball, for me, if it takes seven or eight minutes to come to a decision, you have to stick with the on-field decision. \"If it takes that long for the VAR to make a decision you have to stick to what the decision is. The penalty looked soft but anywhere else on the pitch it gets given.\"\nOn Mohamed Salah:\n\"It's a tough situation. For me, he's one of the greatest players to play for this club. He has been unbelievable for us. I signed the same window as him and we've been through so many highs and lows. \"Whatever happens, happens internally. We're all together in the changing room, and you could see that today. \"I love playing with Mo Salah and I hope to continue playing with him.\"\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nSky Sports' Tim Sherwooddidn't hold back on his assessment of Salah's conduct, describing his comments as 'bang out of order' pre-match. \"Let's have it right, he is one of the best imports we've ever had in the Premier League,\" Sherwood said. \"But, when he comes out and does things like this, it's unsavoury. I don't like it. \"The club is in turmoil, he would know that. The last thing they need is to put this on top of it. If you're a manager you're entitled to do whatever you want regarding players and team selection. \"Unless there's something going on in the background. If it is purely that Arne Slot has left him out for three games and he has thrown his toys out of the pram, then he is bang out of order. \"He's unfortunate that they have strengthened in forward positions. They have a few options if they want to leave Mo Salah out and he's not been playing well. \"For some reason, he feels he is entitled to play every time he's fit to play. That's not the case. The manager is not their to be Mo Salah's babysitter.",

Thomas Frank said he wanted his side to build momentum following Saturday's 2-0 win against Brentford and they certainly did that as penalties from Mohammed Kudus and Xavi Simons - after a David Zima own goal - secured all three points to lift them into ninth. Liverpool's late winner at the San Siro against Inter Milandenied Spurs the chance to move into the top eight, with Arne Slot's side now occupying the final spot in the automatic qualification places for the next phase. Despite not cracking the top eight, the new-found confidence as a result of their upturn in form was clear from minute one. Richarlison and Kudus both went close in the early stages - with the former denied from point-blank range in the first minute - before the breakthrough arrived when Cristian Romero's header from a corner cannoned off Zima to give them a deserved lead. Tottenham's opening goal, a David Zima own goal, was their 100th in the UEFA Champions League in what was their 59th match in the competition. It was another fast start after the restart which led to the second goal of the evening. Pedro Porro was caught late inside the box by Youssoupha Sanyang, attempting to block the full-back's cross, with Kudus then stepping up with confidence to convert from the spot. A perfect evening at the office - which also saw club legend Heung-Min Son presented to the crowd before kick-off in an emotional return for the former captain - was then rounded off by Simons winning and scoring his penalty to make it three on the evening.

      "content": "Middlesbrough maintained their 100 per cent record under new head coach Kim Hellberg with an impressive 2-1 victory at Charlton. Riley McGree and Morgan Whittaker scored during a dominant first half for the visitors at the Valley. George Edmundson's own goal halved the deficit in the closing stages, but second-placed Boro held on to make it three straight wins under the Swede as they closed the gap to leaders Coventry to five points. There was a minute's applause before kick off in memory of Charlton supporter Norman Barker, who passed away during Saturday's abandoned home game against Portsmouth. Only some big saves by Thomas Kaminski prevented the Addicks from trailing by more than two goals at the interval. The Charlton goalkeeper pushed Hayden Hackney's shot around a post in the fourth minute before he produced another strong save shortly afterwards to keep out Alex Bangura's attempt. Kaminski again came to the hosts' rescue in the 33rd minute as he saved Tommy Conway's shot with his legs. Macaulay Gillesphey and Sonny Carey contrived to lose the ball just outside the Charlton penalty area and Delano Burgzorg's sharp cutback was finished first time by McGree. Charlton had a penalty appeal waved away by referee Oliver Langford when Luke Berry went down as he looked to squeeze between Matt Targett and Alfie Jones when latching on to Miles Leaburn's flick. Boro extended their lead in the third minute of first-half stoppage time as Whittaker fired through the legs of Kaminski from McGree's pass after the visitors countered in devastating fashion. Charlton manager Nathan Jones made a triple change at the start of the second half, but they still lacked composure as their opponents carried a huge threat on the counter. Karoy Anderson, one of the changes made by the south Londoners, was dispossessed by Hackney and it needed Kaminski to stop McGree's shot with his outstretched left foot in the 53rd minute. Boro goalkeeper Sol Brynn tipped over a fierce strike by Isaac Olaofe, the first real testing moment he had faced. The away side came close to a third when substitute Luke Ayling's header clipped the top of the crossbar from Sverre Nypan's cross. Charlton pulled a goal back in the 81st minute, Edmundson guiding Rob Apter's cross into his own net. Charlton's Nathan Jones:\n\"One, we want people to come back from injury and two, we want the window to come really quickly. But we also have to be better. \"We tried to find a way to be aggressive and front-footed, we were, but every time we had a decision to make we made poor decisions. They had two counter-attacks and scored them both - we had them and didn't. \"We should have had a penalty. \"They broke and scored what is a killer goal so that we are chasing a 2-0 lead. If it's only one we equalise and I fancy us to go on and win the game. They defended fantastically late on.\"\nMiddlesbrough's Kim Hellberg\n\"No, it is not (easy). But I luckily have a very good squad and a lot of very good people around me. It is small margins, winning or losing games. The way we have performed over those three games we have been the best team. \"It was a very good performance, especially the first half. We should have scored some more goals - we had some brilliant crosses by Bangs (Alex Bangura) that we were close to getting on. We had two or three more big chances. Then we showed character in closing the game down in the second half. \"I'm most proud of Morgan (Whittaker) for the first goal when he lost the ball and did a very good reaction to win it back for us. That becomes a key thing for us not to let them come on the counters. \"Then every time he has a chance to finish he has top quality. \"The mood is good. Entries by 3pm Saturday.",

      "content": "Tonda Eckert continued his impressive start as Southampton manager with a sixth victory in seven games as the Saints held off a West Brom fightback to win 3-2 at St Mary's. Championship top scorer Adam Armstrong scored twice before half-time to take his tally to 11 after Leo Scienza set the hosts on their way with an early goal. The Baggies put up a second-half fight through goals from Karlan Grant and Nathaniel Phillips and went close to a late leveller but have now lost their last seven away games. With such a dismal record on the road, Southampton was not the trip Ryan Mason would have wanted to be making on a windswept Tuesday in December. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nEckert had won all of his three home games in charge of the Saints and they tore into Mason's side. Armstrong had already stung the palms of Joe Wildsmith before Saints led in the 12th minute through Scienza. The goal was made by former Albion winger Tom Fellows, who drove through the heart of midfield from within his own half before feeding Scienza to finish clinically into the far corner. A mistake from West Brom's Krystian Bielik which allowed Armstrong to steal possession and finish emphatically past Wildsmith. Mason's side were looking shellshocked but did carve out a rare chance when Grant found some space down the left and curled the ball beyond the far post. Saints threatened each time they went forward and more great work from Scienza set up Caspar Jander to shoot, but his effort flew over. It seemed only a matter of time before Saints scored again, and Armstrong added his seventh goal in six games as he latched on to Finn Azaz's disguised pass to again finish into the far corner. The small group of travelling supporters booed their side off at half-time. The pace of the game slowed in the second period as Southampton dominated possession and the Baggies sat behind the ball. Grant was West Brom's best player and scored just after the hour mark as he cut in from the left and struck low into the far corner to give the away side hope. Ten minutes from time, Mason's side threatened from successive corners, with Gavin Bazunu saving brilliantly from Bielik and Ryan Manning clearing Jayson Molumby's effort off the line. But with four minutes left Phillips nodded in from Mikey Johnston's corner to ensure a nervy ending for the home side. Samuel Iling-Junior missed a glorious chance to equalise at the death when he somehow put Johnston's cross wide of the post and Saints survived. Southampton's Tonda Eckert:\n\"The very positive thing is that if you have those home games and they become tight towards the end, that you also have a crowd that can bring the game over the line for you. \"I honestly want to thank everyone who came out to St Mary's today because that made a hell of a difference. \"If we have come to the point that we try to look for bits, even though we win, I think that we've come quite to a good state. \"At the same time, obviously we struggled a little bit more in the second half than in the last two games, I think for different reasons. That is definitely something that we're going to address.\"\nWest Brom's Ryan Mason:\n\"I don't read the press so in terms of rumours, it's irrelevant. I'm not a coach, I'm not a manager, I'm not a person who makes excuses in life. \"My job is to turn up every day and try and change the situation, away from home especially. \"The squad is certainly good enough to be in a better position than we are in the league. \"The way we lost the game is difficult to accept. There were some individual mistakes and that can happen, but I think a lack of belief is something which upsets me more. \"I probably believe in this group more than they believe in themselves at the minute. But of course, I understand football, I'm not stupid. Entries by 3pm Saturday.",

But Rangers went straight up the other end and Morgan, who only came on with four minutes of normal time remaining, crashed in a dramatic last-gasp winner. It secured a fourth win from their last five matches for the Hoops, while Birmingham have now lost seven matches on the road this season. QPR, without Moroccan playmaker Ilias Chair through injury, were inches from taking an early lead when a Rhys Norrington-Davies curler from the edge of the box flew just wide. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nBirmingham threatened through Demarai Gray, who was played in behind by Jay Stansfield, when he fizzed in a low cross which was just out of Marvin Ducksch's reach. The hosts looked shaky at the back, but were beginning to find their feet going forward and Amadou Mbengue's cross was nodded back across goal by Koki Saito to Paul Smyth, whose downward header was straight at Blues keeper James Beadle. Saito swung the ball back towards the far post where Rangers captain Dunne rose to powerfully head his second goal of the season past Beadle. The Irish defender had scored a last-minute, 30-yard screamer to win the match the last time these sides met at Loftus Road, two seasons ago. This one was about 29 yards closer. After the break, Beadle just managed to get a palm to a Norrington-Davies cross with Dunne lurking behind him again. Moments later, with Birmingham making unnecessarily hard work of clearing their lines, Smyth stole the ball and crossed towards Mbengue, who could not convert at the far post. Richard Kone should have doubled QPR's lead on the hour from Nicolas Madsen's cross, but volleyed over from six yards out. Birmingham had barely registered an effort on goal all night, but as time ticked away and the homes side retreated, Gray fizzed in a low cross which zipped all the way to Roberts who finished at the far post. But Rangers won a free-kick at the death and Jonathan Varane laid the ball back to Morgan who, from 20 yards out, pinged a superb drive past Beadle to snatch all three points. QPR's Julien Stephan:\n\"It was a lot of positive emotion just after a negative emotion. \"What a fantastic game we did, especially in the second half. I think it was a great game. Usually they are a team who shoots a lot and they shot three times, one on target. \"Then what character after a bad moment. All credit to the players. It was amazing. It's probably why we do this job, to share that emotion.\"\nBirmingham's Chris Davies:\n\"Obviously it's a very painful defeat, as painful as it gets really, to get a goal in the last few minutes and then concede in the last seconds. \"In terms of the game itself we were too slow in the first half. The problem in some ways was the first goal, not the last. \"We gave ourselves too much to do. There had not been a lot of football on show from either team and we needed to get to half-time 0-0 and build from there. \"I don't think we got in their box often. But staying in the game was a good sign and then we think can we get a point, which we nearly did. Entries by 3pm Saturday.",

      "content": "Substitute Vivaldo Semedo's equaliser in the seventh minute of stoppage time denied Sheffield Wednesday a second Championship win of the season. Charlie McNeill's third goal in two games appeared to have handed rock-bottom Wednesday a rare bit of cheer in a difficult campaign. But just when wasteful Watford, who missed a penalty through skipper Imran Louza, seemed to have run out of ideas, Semedo squeezed a volley from Mamadou Doumbia's cross under goalkeeper Pierce Charles to salvage a point. Struggling Wednesday were relieved not to fall behind inside five minutes when Giorgi Chakvetadze strike was too close to goalkeeper Charles from Othmane Maamma's low centre. But from their first meaningful excursion into Watford territory, the Owls went ahead after 17 minutes. Max Alleyne's poor headed clearance from Yan Valery's cross fell straight to McNeill and crisp left-foot shot extended the Hornets' dismal sequence of just one clean sheet since April. It was also the eighth time in 11 home games this season that Watford have conceded the first goal. Louza placed his shot just the wrong side of a post from fellow Moroccan Maamma's pass, before the Golden Ball winner at the Under-20 World Cup was guilty of a glaring miss from six yards. With loyal veteran Barry Bannan marshalling the Owls' resistance, Henrik Pedersen's men somehow held out until the break. As Watford laid siege to the visitors' goal, hapless referee Dean Whitestone's inadvertent body-check on Marc Bola almost set up a Wednesday breakaway, and the visitors were upset when the experienced official stopped play for a drop-ball. Whitestone was the centre of attention again when Louza's penalty, awarded for a foul on Bola by substitute Sean Fusire, rattled the crossbar and Edo Kayembe steered home the rebound. But Kayembe was penalised for encroaching and Watford's night of missed opportunities reached a frustrating new low. Louza did his best to atone for his spot-kick miss, twice extending Charles from long range, and Wednesday looked like holding out until Semedo's second goal of the season broke the 1,578 travelling fans' hearts. Watford's Javi Gracia:\n\"We had good chances, many chances, but (converting them) is something we're not doing well in the last games. \"It's difficult to win games when you don't take them but, for me, it's not just about us taking clear-cut chances - it's about falling behind again and it's something we need to fix. \"We made it difficult for ourselves when we concede from the first shot on our goal. \"It's another point for us but it's not enough. We showed character to fight to the end but I'm disappointed. We have the youngest squad in the Championship and we have to learn from these experiences fast. \"I would like to give value to the opponent because they have had a difficult season and they competed really well tonight. \"But we had an xG of 2.7 goals, so a point is not enough. We needed to take the points but we were conceding easy goals, most goals, in the first half of too many games and we have to fix it.\"\nSheffield Wednesday's Henrik Pedersen:\n\"The first feeling is of disappointment because we were so close - but I'm also very proud because we gave everything and played with a fantastic togetherness. \"The tactical discipline and courage of our players was a big step forward. We know about Watford's speed and power going forward in transition and how we played in the second half was amazing. \"The boys were all disappointed in the dressing room afterwards, but we asked the team for commitment, intensity, discipline and togetherness and they were very, very strong. The players have done a fantastic job and they have grown a lot as a team. Entries by 3pm Saturday.",

      "content": "Sheffield United's four-match winning run came to an end as they were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Norwich. The hosts - whose starting line-up featured eight changes from the weekend due to \"illness and injuries\" - took the lead early in the second half with a goal from Danny Ings. Norwich, though, hit back to equalise with Djibril Soumare scoring an own goal. There were chances at either end during a lively first half, with both keepers called into action. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nIngs headed over an open goal while Norwich keeper Vladan Kovacevic kept out efforts from Tom Cannon and Harrison Burrows. Josh Sargent went desperately close to putting the visitors ahead with an overhead kick which was headed off the line by Ings after the ball remained in play following Michael Cooper's save from Oscar Schwartau. Cooper also pulled off saves from Kellen Fisher and Sargent during the first 45 minutes after seeing an early shot from Jacob Wright go wide of his right-hand post. United's goal came in the 50th minute when Tahith Chong checked back on the right-hand byline inside the area to shrug off Tony Springett and then played a low ball across the face of goal which was tapped in by Ings. Making his 12th appearance for the Blades, it was the striker's first goal for the club. A defensive lapse led to the equalising goal with the defenders failing to clear the danger before Jovon Makama's shot was turned into his own net by Soumare. Late in the game, United's Patrick Bamford threatened to get on the end of a ball played into the area by fellow substitute Gus Hamer while Tyrese Campbell put a far-post effort wide. Another substitute, Andre Brooks, also posed problems down the right-hand side but it was Norwich who had the best chance to snatch victory in time added on. With United throwing players forward, substitute Amankwah Forson won possession in his own half and made a surging run through the middle, finding himself through on goal, but his low shot was touched wide by Cooper. Forson was left holding his head in frustration, with the final whistle blown shortly afterwards. Sheffield United's Chris Wilder:\n\"I've got to say, personally for myself and the coaches, it's possibly one of the most challenging last 24-48 hours that we've had. Players dropping out like flies and stuff like that. \"I think you always understand as a manager, every decision you make is put under the spotlight. One of those decisions that I made today for that team selection wasn't a tactical one, it was a physical situation. \"Should have won it I think, in my opinion. But you've got to give the opposition credit. They started brighter than us. \"We started to get back in the game and created some good chances, got ourselves in front. I can't fault the players' attitude, can't really fault the players' application in trying to win the game. \"We'd love to have kept the run going, the winning run, but we haven't. We've got to reset and go again Friday (against West Brom) and see who's available.\"\nNorwich's Philippe Clement:\n\"If you see how the squad is stretched for the moment and you need to play players out of position, players coming in, players coming out of injury. I'm really proud what the team showed today. \"So the important thing is, after three weeks together, you see that everybody knows the basics of their job, what to do, and that they did today. \"A lot of good stuff together as a team, in organisation, but also on the ball. We've seen a team against a good opponent and we had a lot of good moments on the ball, creating the right spaces, creating good chances also. \"And then it's disappointing. It's two away games in a row that we're alone in front of the goalkeeper - that's the best chance you can have in football - that we don't score those because then these weeks could have been totally different than they are now. \"The belief is there. It's clear for everybody. The team is working really hard, giving their all in every game. Entries by 3pm Saturday.",

      "title": "Arsenal’s Pressing Structure Under Scrutiny After Draw With Manchester City",
      "content": "Arsenal’s 1-1 draw with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday offered another illustration of how Mikel Arteta’s side continues to evolve tactically, particularly in the first phase of their defensive press. While the result keeps Arsenal firmly in the title race, analysts have noted that the Gunners’ pressing structure showed both promise and vulnerability throughout the encounter. Arsenal began the match with an aggressive 4-4-2 pressing shape, pushing Declan Rice high alongside Gabriel Jesus to block Rodri’s access to the ball. The approach disrupted City’s rhythm early, forcing the champions to play longer passes than usual. For a 20-minute period, Arsenal’s press generated several turnovers in advanced areas, one of which led to Bukayo Saka hitting the post. But City gradually adjusted. Pep Guardiola instructed his full-backs to invert more aggressively, allowing the midfield to overload central zones. This created dilemmas for Arsenal’s wingers, who were caught between engaging the full-backs or protecting the half-spaces. Once City found their passing lanes, Arsenal’s press became stretched, and Erling Haaland’s equaliser came from a sequence in which the Gunners failed to recover compactness quickly enough. Arteta acknowledged after the match that the team’s timing in the press “needs refinement,” though he insisted the structure remains effective when executed with precision. Analysts argue that Arsenal’s young squad is still mastering the nuance of when to press, when to delay, and how to maintain vertical compactness against teams capable of manipulating space as well as City. Still, there were positives. William Saliba and Gabriel produced another commanding display at centre-back, repeatedly winning duels against Haaland in open play. Meanwhile, Martin Ødegaard’s energy in the second line of pressure helped Arsenal transition quickly once possession was regained. With Liverpool and Tottenham applying pressure near the top of the table, Arsenal know small details could determine the trajectory of their campaign. The draw keeps them within touching distance of first place, but upcoming fixtures against Chelsea and Manchester United will provide further tests of their evolving pressing identity. For now, Arteta will be encouraged by the resilience displayed but aware that refinement is needed if Arsenal are to outmanoeuvre their closest rivals in the decisive stages of the season.",

      "title": "Chelsea Facing Selection Dilemma as Key Injuries Mount During Winter Run",
      "content": "Chelsea’s preparations for a crucial stretch of fixtures have been complicated by a growing injury list, raising concerns about squad depth and tactical continuity. Mauricio Pochettino, who has guided the team back into European contention, now faces significant decisions regarding rotation as the Blues navigate domestic and continental commitments. The most notable setback is the hamstring injury to Enzo Fernández, who limped off during the weekend victory over Brighton. Initial assessments suggest the midfielder could miss several weeks, leaving Chelsea without their most consistent ball-progressor. With Conor Gallagher also managing a minor ankle issue, the central midfield options are suddenly limited. Pochettino may be forced to rely more heavily on Moisés Caicedo and young prospect Carney Chukwuemeka, who impressed in a brief cameo against Brighton. Caicedo’s defensive coverage remains valuable, but Chelsea will need someone capable of carrying the ball through pressure and linking with the attacking trio. This responsibility could fall to Cole Palmer, who has already demonstrated an ability to drift inside and influence the build-up. In addition to midfield concerns, the Blues are dealing with defensive uncertainty. Reece James continues his recovery from a long-term muscle injury, while Benoît Badiashile remains short of full match sharpness. These absences have forced Pochettino to use makeshift backlines in several fixtures, affecting defensive cohesion. The manager, however, remains optimistic. “It’s an opportunity for others to step up,” Pochettino said. “We’ve shown we can adapt, and we’ll continue to find solutions.” His remarks reflect a broader confidence within the squad, buoyed by recent improvements in chance creation and transitional defending. Chelsea’s upcoming matches against Liverpool and Tottenham could define their season trajectory. Results in those encounters will depend heavily on whether Pochettino can maintain tactical stability despite the personnel challenges. Supporters have welcomed the team’s progress after inconsistent performances last season, but there is recognition that the next month will test both mental resilience and strategic flexibility. If the replacements can deliver, Chelsea may remain contenders for a top-four finish. If not, the winter period could expose the limits of a squad still undergoing reconstruction.",

      "title": "Liverpool’s Midfield Rotation Raises Questions Ahead of Festive Schedule",
      "content": "Liverpool’s narrow 2-1 victory over Fulham at Anfield extended their unbeaten run to nine matches, but Jürgen Klopp now confronts a selection puzzle as he attempts to manage player workloads in a congested period. The midfield trio, central to Liverpool’s resurgence this season, has undergone several rotations in recent weeks, prompting debate about optimal combinations. Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have been constants in the side, but Klopp has experimented with varying roles for Ryan Gravenberch, Curtis Jones, and Wataru Endo. The challenge lies in balancing creative output with defensive stability. Mac Allister, deployed deeper in recent fixtures, has provided composure in possession but occasionally struggled when isolated in transition. Against Fulham, Liverpool appeared vulnerable when pressed aggressively, particularly after Gravenberch replaced Jones early in the second half. While Gravenberch offers powerful ball-carrying, he is still adapting to the pace of Premier League defensive reads. Fulham found pockets of space behind him, forcing Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté into several recovery interventions. Klopp acknowledged the issue post-match. “We need fresh legs, but also the right balance,” he said. “It’s not just about who is fit, but who fits the game.” His comments suggest that tactical considerations will shape upcoming selections more than mere rotation necessity. Liverpool’s attacking rhythm has remained strong, thanks largely to Mohamed Salah’s consistency and Darwin Núñez’s improved link-up play. Yet the midfield remains the engine of Klopp’s system, and any fluctuation in structure can significantly affect pressing patterns and transition control. With upcoming matches against Arsenal and Manchester United, Liverpool must find a stable configuration that maintains intensity without overextending key players. The festive period has historically been decisive in shaping title races, and Liverpool’s midfield management could be the factor that determines whether they remain genuine challengers into the spring. For now, the Reds sit comfortably near the top of the table, but refinement—and perhaps luck with fitness—will be essential in navigating the demanding weeks ahead.",

      "content": "Manchester United’s erratic form continued with a 2-2 draw against West Ham, intensifying scrutiny on manager Erik ten Hag as the club struggles to establish an identity this season. While United showed flashes of fluid attacking play, defensive lapses and inconsistency off the ball remain recurring issues. United began brightly, with Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Højlund linking effectively in the first half. The pair combined for several promising transitions, one of which led to Rashford’s opening goal. However, as the match progressed, United’s midfield shape deteriorated. Casemiro, returning from injury, appeared short of match sharpness, and West Ham exploited the space around him with quick vertical passes. Ten Hag’s decision to substitute Casemiro for Sofyan Amrabat at halftime improved ball circulation but did little to address defensive fragility. West Ham’s equaliser stemmed from a broken press in which neither Bruno Fernandes nor Scott McTominay tracked runners effectively. These structural lapses have become familiar frustrations for supporters. Offensively, United still rely heavily on individual brilliance. While Højlund’s movement continues to impress, service remains inconsistent. Antony and Alejandro Garnacho each produced moments of creativity but were unable to sustain pressure throughout the match. Ten Hag has spoken repeatedly about the need for “collective discipline,” yet United often struggle to maintain compactness across both phases of play. The manager dismissed speculation about his future, insisting the squad is “moving in the right direction.” But with United sitting mid-table and facing a daunting run of fixtures, pressure is mounting externally. Analysts argue that without a clearer identity—whether in pressing intensity, build-up structure, or defensive organisation—United risk further regression. Upcoming matches against Liverpool and Manchester City will test the squad’s resilience. A strong response could stabilise the atmosphere around the club; further setbacks may fuel speculation about strategic changes at both managerial and squad-building levels. For now, United remain a team of potential but insufficient consistency, with Ten Hag tasked with finding solutions quickly.",

      "content": "Tottenham suffered a 3-2 defeat at St James’ Park, raising renewed concerns about the sustainability of their high defensive line under manager Ange Postecoglou. While Spurs have earned praise for their attacking intent this season, the loss highlighted vulnerabilities that opponents continue to exploit. Spurs dominated early possession, with James Maddison orchestrating the build-up and Son Heung-min stretching Newcastle’s back four. Tottenham created several high-quality chances but failed to convert, leaving the door open for Newcastle’s counter-attacks. The first goal Tottenham conceded illustrated the risk inherent in their approach. A quick turnover in midfield left centre-backs Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven exposed in a two-on-two. Newcastle’s Alexander Isak capitalised, timing his run perfectly and finishing past Guglielmo Vicario. Postecoglou defended his philosophy after the match, emphasising that the team must “stay brave” and trust the process. Yet critics argue that Spurs’ defensive transitions lack the necessary compactness, especially when full-backs push high simultaneously. Opponents have increasingly targeted the space behind Tottenham’s back line, knowing the team’s recovery structure remains inconsistent. Offensively, Spurs continue to show promise. Brennan Johnson delivered one of his strongest performances of the season, repeatedly beating his defender and providing two assists. But despite generating expected goals significantly above Newcastle’s, Tottenham were undone by moments of defensive disorganisation. The defeat leaves Spurs battling to stay in the Champions League positions. With fixtures against Arsenal and Chelsea looming, Postecoglou faces questions about whether tactical adjustments—perhaps selectively lowering the defensive line—are necessary. For now, Tottenham remain an exciting but unpredictable side, capable of overwhelming opponents but equally vulnerable when their aggressive shape is pierced.",

      "content": "Manchester City’s 2-0 win over Crystal Palace at the weekend showcased their depth once again, but Pep Guardiola’s rotation strategy is drawing attention as the champions attempt to navigate injuries and maintain momentum in a tight title race. City were without Kevin De Bruyne and Phil Foden, both managing minor muscle issues, forcing Guardiola to rely heavily on academy graduate Oscar Bobb and veteran Ilkay Gündogan. Bobb’s creativity helped unlock Palace’s compact defensive block, while Gündogan’s positional intelligence ensured control in midfield. Guardiola has rotated more frequently than in previous seasons, a decision partly influenced by the compressed schedule and City’s involvement in multiple competitions. While the approach has kept players fresh, it has also led to occasional disruptions in rhythm. City’s draw with Arsenal earlier this month exposed moments where their automatisms appeared less sharp. Still, the manager insists the strategy is necessary. “We must protect players, especially as the season becomes more demanding,” Guardiola said. Analysts note that City’s depth—a hallmark of their success—allows them to absorb injuries better than most Premier League sides. Yet maintaining tactical cohesion remains a delicate balance. The biggest question surrounds Erling Haaland, who has started nearly every league match. Guardiola acknowledged the need to rest him but admitted the striker’s competitive mentality makes rotation challenging. With Champions League knockout rounds approaching, managing Haaland’s workload could become critical. City remain within touching distance of first place, but with Arsenal and Liverpool performing strongly, every point carries weight. Whether Guardiola’s rotation approach provides long-term advantage or introduces short-term inconsistency will be one of the defining storylines in the months ahead.",

Once praised for their structured build-up play and proactive defensive organisation, Brighton now find themselves struggling to contain opponents in transition and set-piece situations. Manager Roberto De Zerbi has attempted several tactical tweaks, including shifting from a 4-2-3-1 to a back-three system. However, Brighton continue to concede chances from wide overloads and second-ball situations. Wolves’ opener came from a recycled set-piece in which Brighton failed to clear the initial delivery and lost the aerial duel on the follow-up. The departure of key midfielders during the summer has disrupted Brighton’s ability to control matches. Without consistent ball retention, the back line is facing increased pressure, exposing gaps that opponents have exploited. Lewis Dunk, usually a stabilising presence, has struggled to manage defensive organisation amid constant structural changes. Brighton’s attacking play still offers glimpses of quality. João Pedro and Simon Adingra created several chances against Wolves, though finishing remains inconsistent. De Zerbi emphasised post-match that “performance levels are improving,” but admitted that defensive lapses must be addressed urgently. With fixtures against Tottenham, Aston Villa, and Liverpool approaching, Brighton must stabilise quickly to avoid sinking deeper into the bottom three.

Watkins scored twice and assisted another, continuing a run of form that has made him one of the Premier League’s most influential forwards this season. Manager Unai Emery has built a system that maximises Watkins’ strengths: relentless movement, intelligent pressing triggers, and the ability to combine with advanced midfielders. Against Bournemouth, Villa consistently created overloads in the right half-space, allowing Watkins and Moussa Diaby to exploit gaps between defenders. Villa’s midfield trio—Douglas Luiz, Boubacar Kamara, and John McGinn—controlled the tempo throughout the match. Their positioning prevented Bournemouth from progressing centrally, forcing turnovers that Villa quickly converted into counter-attacking opportunities. Defensively, Villa have also shown improvement. Pau Torres and Ezri Konsa provided stability, while full-backs Matty Cash and Alex Moreno contributed both offensively and defensively. The clean sheet marks Villa’s fourth in seven matches, suggesting Emery’s defensive principles are taking hold. With rivals for European spots dropping points, Villa have positioned themselves as serious contenders for a top-six finish. Watkins’ form will be central to sustaining that momentum. If he continues scoring at his current rate, he may enter the conversation for individual awards as well. For now, Villa look balanced, confident, and capable of challenging any team in the league, a testament to Emery’s long-term project taking shape.",

While each club has displayed distinct stylistic strengths, underlying metrics suggest the race may remain tight well into the spring. Arsenal currently lead the league in expected goals against (xGA), demonstrating the effectiveness of their structured defensive setup. William Saliba and Gabriel have formed the most resilient centre-back partnership in the league, conceding fewer big chances than any other team. Arsenal’s pressing efficiency has also improved, with the team ranking second in high turnovers per match. Liverpool, meanwhile, lead in expected goals (xG) and shot quality metrics.

Manchester City remain dominant in possession-based metrics, controlling an average of 64% possession per match—the highest in the league. Their pass completion rate in the final third and progressive passes per 90 minutes continue to reflect their established positional play.

      "content": "Everton’s 1-1 draw with Southampton offered signs of improvement following last week’s managerial change, but the club remains entrenched in a difficult relegation battle. Newly appointed manager Graham Potter faces the challenge of instilling tactical stability in a squad that has endured multiple system changes over the past year. Potter, known for his flexible and possession-focused approach, opted for a 3-4-2-1 system in his first match. Everton displayed improved ball retention and more controlled build-up play compared to previous weeks. Dwight McNeil and Jack Harrison were given freedom to drift into central pockets, helping Everton break Southampton’s mid-block. However, Everton’s defensive structure remains fragile. Southampton created several high-quality chances late in the match, exposing gaps in Everton’s back line during transitions. Centre-backs James Tarkowski and Jarrad Branthwaite produced strong individual performances but were left isolated too often. The key question is whether Potter can quickly implement the level of positional discipline required for his system to function. Everton supporters expressed optimism about the team’s improved fluidity but remain aware that results must follow. With fixtures against Wolves and Brighton approaching, Everton cannot afford to let performance improvements fail to translate into points. The club’s board has indicated full backing for Potter, but the reality of the relegation battle means patience may be limited. If Everton can stabilise defensively while building on their improved attacking structure, they may climb out of the bottom three. But the margin for error is shrinking.",

      "content": "Newcastle’s 2-0 loss to Aston Villa has further dimmed their hopes of qualifying for European competition, with injuries once again overshadowing performance analysis. Eddie Howe’s side has struggled to maintain consistency amid a relentless sequence of fitness setbacks affecting key players. The latest blow is the groin injury suffered by midfielder Bruno Guimarães, whose absence leaves Newcastle without their most influential tempo-setter. With Sandro Tonali still unavailable and Joe Willock returning only gradually from injury, Newcastle’s midfield depth is severely tested. Defensively, the long-term absences of Sven Botman and Dan Burn have forced Howe to rotate frequently, disrupting cohesion. Against Villa, Newcastle conceded from two situations in which their defensive line failed to stay compact, leaving space between centre-backs that Watkins exploited. Offensively, Newcastle remain dangerous but inconsistent. Anthony Gordon and Miguel Almirón created moments of threat, yet Newcastle’s lack of control in midfield prevented them from sustaining pressure. Howe lamented the team’s inability to “manage phases of the game,” a recurring theme this season. As the fixture list tightens, Newcastle must rely on squad players to maintain competitiveness. Whether they can do so may determine the difference between a mid-table finish and salvaging a European push. Supporters remain hopeful, but the club’s injury crisis remains a significant barrier to progress.",

      "content": "West Ham’s 2-2 draw with Manchester United has been widely regarded as a demonstration of the team’s tactical discipline under David Moyes. While the Hammers conceded twice, their overall structure and ability to exploit United’s weaknesses earned praise. Moyes set up in a compact 4-4-2 mid-block, allowing United to hold possession but directing them into less dangerous areas. The strategy relied on disciplined spacing between lines, with Edson Álvarez providing cover in front of the back four. West Ham limited United’s penetration through central zones, forcing them to attempt crosses from deeper areas. Offensively, West Ham were efficient. Jarrod Bowen and Mohammed Kudus combined well in transitional moments, repeatedly testing United’s fragmented defensive structure. Bowen’s equaliser, a well-placed finish after a swift counter-attack, highlighted West Ham’s ability to punish lapses. Moyes credited his players for “executing the plan with maturity,” particularly noting improvement in game management. Analysts agree that West Ham appear more balanced this season, blending disciplined defensive work with explosive counter-attacks. With the club pushing for a top-eight finish, performances like this suggest they are capable of competing with stronger opponents. Consistency remains the challenge, but the tactical identity Moyes has crafted continues to yield competitive results.",

      "content": "Crystal Palace’s 1-0 defeat to Brentford has intensified concerns about their lack of attacking output, with the club now scoring fewer goals than any other side in the league over the past eight matches. Manager Oliver Glasner has maintained faith in his current squad but acknowledged the need for reinforcements in the January window. Palace created few meaningful chances against Brentford, struggling to progress the ball through midfield under pressure. Eberechi Eze, returning from injury, showed flashes of creativity but was often isolated due to Palace’s difficulty building sustained possession. Jean-Philippe Mateta worked tirelessly off the ball but received limited service. Palace’s crossing accuracy and final-pass decision-making have been issues throughout the season, and opponents have increasingly crowded central areas to neutralise Eze and Michael Olise. Glasner has experimented with different attacking combinations, including deploying Jordan Ayew as a central playmaker, but solutions have proven temporary at best. Analysts suggest that Palace need a dynamic ball-carrier or a more clinical finisher to relieve scoring pressure. Defensively, Palace remain competitive, with Marc Guéhi and Joachim Andersen continuing to impress. However, without greater attacking threat, the team risks being dragged deeper into the relegation battle. January may be pivotal.

The winning goal came from a rehearsed corner routine, with centre-back Ethan Pinnock heading in after a well-placed delivery. Brentford rank among the league leaders in set-piece goals, accounting for a significant portion of their total scoring output. Frank attributes the success to meticulous preparation and strong aerial personnel. “We take pride in these moments,” he said after the match. “They are essential parts of the game and can provide decisive advantages.”\n\nBeyond set-pieces, Brentford’s defensive organisation has improved in recent weeks. The midfield pairing of Christian Nørgaard and Vitaly Janelt provided protection in front of the back line, limiting Palace’s ability to create centrally. Brentford’s compact structure forced opponents into low-percentage shots. While Brentford’s attacking play in open play remains functional rather than spectacular, their efficiency in key moments has secured valuable points.

Manager Marco Silva has emphasised organisation, tempo control, and quick vertical passing as central components of the team’s identity. João Palhinha once again dominated the defensive midfield role, winning duels and enabling Fulham to break up Forest’s attempts to progress. His presence allows Silva to deploy two more attack-minded midfielders ahead of him, with Andreas Pereira and Tom Cairney excelling in linking play and supporting the front line. Fulham’s transitions were particularly effective. Pereira’s ability to find space between Forest’s midfield lines helped initiate attacks, while Cairney’s composure ensured possession was not wasted in advanced areas. Fulham’s attacking trio also impressed. Raúl Jiménez scored his fifth goal in seven matches, capitalising on improved service and sharper movement inside the box. Willian and Harry Wilson stretched Forest’s defence throughout the match, preventing them from crowding central zones. Silva expressed satisfaction with the team’s cohesion: “The midfield structure gives us stability. From there, we can build.” Analysts note that Fulham appear more complete than last season, with fewer vulnerabilities in transitions and more varied attacking patterns.

Their resurgence stems from a shift toward more compact defensive structures and faster attacking transitions. O’Neil has implemented a more conservative pressing strategy, allowing Wolves to maintain a stable shape and break through wide channels. Matheus Cunha’s performance was central to this approach, serving both as a link player and a transitional outlet. His goal and assist against Brighton highlighted his growing importance. In midfield, João Gomes and Mario Lemina provided energy and ball-winning ability, enabling Wolves to win second balls and launch counters. Their ability to anticipate Brighton’s rotations prevented the visitors from controlling central areas. Defensively, Wolves appear more disciplined than earlier in the season. Craig Dawson’s leadership and Toti Gomes’ mobility have created a stable partnership. The back line has conceded fewer shots from high-value zones in recent weeks, signalling improved defensive cohesion.

      "content": "The latest North London derby delivered more than just drama and emotion; it showcased how both Arsenal and Tottenham have evolved tactically under Mikel Arteta and Ange Postecoglou. Arsenal’s 3-2 victory at the Emirates was built on aggressive pressing and flexible positional play, while Spurs once again demonstrated their commitment to a high defensive line and proactive football. Arsenal started in a 4-3-3 structure that often morphed into a 3-2-5 in possession, with Oleksandr Zinchenko stepping into midfield alongside Declan Rice. This gave Arsenal numerical superiority in the centre of the pitch, allowing Martin Ødegaard to find pockets of space behind Tottenham’s midfield. Spurs, sticking to their principles, maintained a high line with Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven tasked with defending large spaces. Early on, the plan nearly worked to perfection as Tottenham caught Arsenal offside several times and launched quick counters through Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski. However, as the match progressed, Arsenal’s rotations began to pull Spurs’ structure apart. Bukayo Saka repeatedly attacked the space behind Destiny Udogie, while Gabriel Jesus drifted wide to create overloads. The opening goal came from such a sequence, with Jesus drawing a centre-back out of position before cutting the ball back for Saka to finish. Tottenham responded through their own attacking patterns. James Maddison exploited gaps between the lines, and their equaliser arrived after a crisp passing move that bypassed Arsenal’s press. Yet, the same ambition that fuels Spurs’ attacking threat also leaves them vulnerable. Arsenal’s second and third goals both stemmed from quick balls in behind the high line, exposing the difficulty of maintaining such an aggressive shape over 90 minutes. Arteta praised his team’s adaptability, highlighting their improved game management in the closing stages. Arsenal shifted into a more compact 4-4-1-1 out of possession, limiting Spurs’ ability to progress centrally and forcing them into low-percentage crosses. For Postecoglou, the performance reinforced the fine margins of his approach. Spurs remain one of the league’s most entertaining sides, but their willingness to defend high will continue to be scrutinised in fixtures against elite opposition. The derby underlined a broader trend: Arsenal’s growing tactical maturity versus Tottenham’s high-risk, high-reward identity. As both clubs push for Champions League qualification, these contrasting philosophies will continue to shape one of the Premier League’s most compelling rivalries.",

      "content": "Liverpool’s 2-0 win over West Ham kept them firmly in the title conversation, but an escalating injury list is creating anxiety around Anfield. Jürgen Klopp’s side has been lauded for its refreshed energy and attacking dynamism this season, yet the strain of a busy calendar is beginning to show. The most pressing concern is the fitness of Mohamed Salah, who was withdrawn with a suspected hamstring issue midway through the second half. While the extent of the injury is still being assessed, any absence for the Egyptian would significantly impact Liverpool’s attacking structure. Salah remains central to their chance creation, combining goalscoring with intelligent movement that opens space for others. Liverpool are also managing knocks to Andy Robertson and Ibrahima Konaté, both of whom have missed recent matches. Kostas Tsimikas has deputised efficiently at left-back, but the drop-off in defensive familiarity is evident. In central defence, Klopp has rotated between Konaté, Virgil van Dijk, and Joe Gomez to manage minutes, yet continuity has been difficult to achieve. In midfield, Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have logged heavy workloads. Klopp has used Wataru Endo and Ryan Gravenberch to provide rotation, though each is still adapting to the Premier League’s demands. The risk is that overuse of key players could lead to fatigue-related injuries later in the campaign. Despite these issues, Liverpool’s performance levels remain high. Against West Ham, they controlled possession, pressed aggressively, and generated a significant volume of chances. Darwin Núñez continued his improved form with another goal, while Luis Díaz offered consistent threat from the left. Klopp has stressed the importance of squad depth, insisting fringe players must be ready to step in. Youngsters such as Ben Doak and Jarell Quansah may see more opportunities if injuries persist. The January transfer window could also present an opportunity to reinforce certain areas, though Liverpool have traditionally avoided panic signings. As the title race intensifies with Arsenal and Manchester City also in strong form, Liverpool’s ability to cope with injuries may prove decisive. The system and identity are clear; maintaining the fitness of those who execute it will be the key challenge in the months ahead.",

      "content": "Chelsea’s 3-3 draw with Manchester City at Stamford Bridge was a captivating advert for the Premier League, but it also raised important questions about Mauricio Pochettino’s defensive structure. While Chelsea’s attacking performance was among their best of the season, their organisation without the ball remains a work in progress. Pochettino opted for a 4-2-3-1 system, with Moisés Caicedo and Enzo Fernández forming the double pivot behind an advanced front four. In possession, Chelsea were fluid and brave, pressing high and committing numbers forward. Cole Palmer and Raheem Sterling stretched City’s back line, creating space for Nicolas Jackson to attack. However, against a side as precise as City, any structural imperfection is punished. Chelsea’s press was frequently bypassed when City dropped a midfielder between the centre-backs, forming a temporary back three. This created overloads in the first phase, drawing Chelsea’s wingers inside and opening lanes to the full-backs. City’s first goal came after Chelsea failed to adjust to this rotation, allowing Bernardo Silva to receive between the lines with time to pick a pass. The hosts improved after the break, narrowing the distances between their lines and showing greater discipline in tracking runners. Still, City continued to find pockets of space, particularly when Erling Haaland drifted wide to disrupt Chelsea’s marking scheme. On the positive side, Chelsea’s resilience and attacking sharpness were evident. Palmer’s equalising penalty in stoppage time capped a performance full of maturity against his former club. Pochettino will be encouraged by the team’s willingness to compete physically and technically with the reigning champions. Yet defensive consistency remains elusive. Chelsea conceded high-quality chances from both open play and set pieces, an area Pochettino has emphasised in training. Until the structure becomes more robust, especially in transition, Chelsea may struggle to convert strong performances into reliable results. The draw suggests the project is moving in the right direction, but it also underlines the fine margins at the top level. For Chelsea to return to genuine title contention in future seasons, resolving these defensive details will be essential.",

      "content": "Marcus Rashford’s fluctuating form has become a focal point of discussion around Manchester United’s season. The forward, who enjoyed a prolific campaign last year, has struggled to consistently influence matches in recent months, raising questions about both individual confidence and United’s broader attacking structure. Rashford has often been deployed on the left of a front three, tasked with stretching defences and attacking the space behind opposition full-backs. However, United’s build-up play has frequently been disjointed, leaving him isolated or forced to receive with his back to goal in crowded areas. Erik ten Hag’s emphasis on quick transitions suits Rashford’s pace, but the team’s difficulty in progressing the ball through midfield has limited those opportunities. When United do break, the lack of coordinated support runs has further constrained Rashford’s impact. Statistically, Rashford’s shot volume and touches in the penalty area have both declined compared to last season. Analysts point to fewer high-quality chances rather than a dramatic drop in finishing ability as a key factor. His expected goals metrics suggest he is underperforming slightly, but the larger issue remains chance creation. Ten Hag has defended Rashford, insisting the forward “will find his rhythm” as United improve collectively. There have been encouraging signs in recent matches, with Rashford scoring in back-to-back games and appearing more confident in one-on-one situations. Tactically, United may need to adjust to maximise his strengths. Using a more stable midfield trio could provide a better platform for controlled possession, allowing Rashford to receive earlier and in more favourable positions. Greater rotation between Rashford and the central striker might also make United less predictable. With United chasing a top-four spot and facing scrutiny from supporters, Rashford’s form will be crucial. If he can rediscover his consistency, he has the potential to transform United’s attacking outlook. For now, his situation serves as a barometer of a team still searching for a cohesive identity in the final third.",

      "content": "Darwin Núñez’s recent performances suggest he is becoming an increasingly central figure in Liverpool’s attacking evolution under Jürgen Klopp. Once criticised for erratic finishing and inconsistent decision-making, the Uruguayan striker has refined his game and is now contributing regularly in goals, assists, and overall link-up play. In Liverpool’s 3-1 win over Brighton, Núñez scored once and assisted another, showcasing both his movement and improved composure in front of goal. His ability to run in behind defensive lines remains a key asset, but he has added greater subtlety to his game, frequently dropping into half-spaces to connect with midfielders. Statistically, Núñez is among the league leaders in shots per 90 minutes and expected goals. Importantly for Liverpool, his conversion rate has improved, reducing the narrative that he is wasteful. His pressing from the front also fits Klopp’s demands, often triggering the press that allows Liverpool to win the ball high. Núñez’s partnership with Mohamed Salah has been particularly fruitful. Salah’s tendency to drift inside from the right creates central overloads, giving Núñez more freedom to attack the channels. When Luis Díaz or Diogo Jota occupy the opposite flank, Liverpool can stretch defences both horizontally and vertically. Klopp has praised Núñez for his “mentality and willingness to learn,” noting that the striker has worked hard on timing his runs and making better decisions in the box. While occasional erratic moments remain, the overall trajectory is markedly positive. With Liverpool competing on multiple fronts, Núñez’s continued development could be decisive. His presence offers a different profile to Roberto Firmino’s previous role, adding a more direct, explosive threat while still allowing for intricate combination play. If his current form persists, Núñez may establish himself as one of the Premier League’s most impactful forwards, transforming perceptions and underlining Liverpool’s attacking depth in the process.",

Forest twice let a lead slip, while Sheffield United again showed effort but lacked the quality to fully capitalise. Forest started brighter, pressing aggressively and forcing mistakes from the visitors’ back line. Morgan Gibbs-White orchestrated attacks from the right half-space, sliding passes into Taiwo Awoniyi and Anthony Elanga. The opening goal arrived when Awoniyi outmuscled his marker and finished calmly after a swift transition. Yet defensive lapses quickly reappeared. Forest’s midfield failed to track runners, allowing Sheffield United to equalise from a cut-back after a simple overlap on the left flank. The pattern repeated in the second half, with Forest regaining the lead from a set-piece only to concede again from a poorly defended cross. Sheffield United will take some encouragement from their resilience but remain short of cutting-edge quality. Their attacking play depended heavily on long balls and second phases, with limited sustained possession. When they did move the ball through midfield, execution in the final third often broke down. For Forest, the draw feels like a missed opportunity. Nuno Espírito Santo will be frustrated by the team’s inability to manage the game once ahead. The defensive structure, particularly when defending wide areas, requires urgent improvement. Both clubs remain in the relegation zone, and matches like this emphasise how fine the margins will be.

      "title": "Pressure Builds on Premier League Managers in Tightest Title Race for Years",
      "content": "With Arsenal, Liverpool, and Manchester City separated by only a handful of points, the psychological and tactical pressure on their managers is intensifying. Mikel Arteta, Jürgen Klopp, and Pep Guardiola are all attempting to balance rotation, tactical evolution, and expectation in what is shaping up to be one of the closest title races in recent memory. Arteta has guided Arsenal into genuine contention for a second successive season. His focus has been on refining defensive structure and game control, but the burden of maintaining consistency with a relatively young squad is evident. Every dropped point is magnified, and his decisions on rotation, particularly around key players like Bukayo Saka and Declan Rice, invite constant scrutiny. Klopp, meanwhile, is managing what could be his final title push with this Liverpool group. The squad has been refreshed in midfield, but the demands of competing domestically and in Europe mean he must constantly weigh short-term results against long-term fitness. His emotional connection with supporters amplifies both praise and criticism. Guardiola faces a different kind of pressure. Having set unprecedented standards with Manchester City, anything less than sustained dominance is considered underachievement by some observers. The expectation that City will eventually surge clear in the table adds a unique psychological dimension; every draw is analysed as evidence of possible decline. Tactically, all three managers are making subtle adjustments. Arsenal have shown more willingness to control games through possession rather than pressing alone. Liverpool are experimenting with different midfield combinations to sustain intensity. City, dealing with injuries and rotation, are occasionally adopting a more pragmatic approach. Each manager insists on focusing “one game at a time,” but the wider narrative is inescapable. Head-to-head encounters will be pivotal, yet points dropped against mid-table sides could be equally decisive. How each manager handles the coming weeks—both in the dressing room and on the training ground—may ultimately determine who lifts the trophy. In a race defined by fine margins, psychological resilience could be as important as tactical innovation.",

      "content": "A statistical review of set-piece performance among the Premier League’s big six offers insight into where the title and top-four races may be won and lost. Corners, free-kicks, and attacking throw-ins continue to play a decisive role in tight matches, and certain clubs are extracting greater value from these situations than others. Manchester City lead the way in set-piece xG created, reflecting both the quality of delivery and the variety of routines. Their ability to crowd the six-yard box while also threatening at the edge of the area makes them difficult to defend. Rúben Dias and Nathan Aké are frequent targets, while players like Rodri occupy defenders with decoy runs. Arsenal have also improved markedly, ranking near the top for set-piece goals scored. The presence of William Saliba, Gabriel, and Declan Rice provides significant aerial threat, and set-piece coach Nicolas Jover’s influence is evident in rehearsed movements that create free headers or second-ball opportunities. Liverpool, historically strong from set pieces, remain dangerous but slightly less dominant than in previous seasons. Virgil van Dijk continues to attract defensive attention, allowing others such as Ibrahima Konaté and Darwin Núñez to attack space. However, their conversion rate from corners has fluctuated, leaving room for improvement. At the other end, Tottenham and Manchester United lag behind in both set-piece goals and xG. Spurs’ aggressive, open-play style means they generate many chances before resorting to set-piece reliance, but their routines have lacked consistency. United, meanwhile, have struggled to find a regular set-piece taker and to create clear aerial mismatches. Chelsea sit in the middle of the pack, with Benoît Badiashile and Thiago Silva providing aerial presence. Their delivery has improved with the emergence of Cole Palmer as a dead-ball specialist, yet defensive set-pieces remain a concern, as they concede more shots from second phases than other top-six rivals. In a season where margins at the top appear razor-thin, proficiency from set pieces could provide decisive points. The data suggests City and Arsenal currently hold the edge in this department—a factor that may prove significant as the campaign reaches its decisive stages.",

      "content": "With the January transfer window approaching, Manchester United face important decisions that could shape their push for a top-four finish. The club’s uneven performances this season have highlighted two key areas requiring reinforcement: central midfield control and defensive depth. United’s midfield has lacked consistency in both availability and structure. Casemiro’s injuries and fluctuating form have left the team vulnerable in transition, while Christian Eriksen’s fitness issues have reduced creativity from deep areas. Sofyan Amrabat has provided work rate but is still integrating into the system. Recruiting a press-resistant midfielder capable of dictating tempo and offering defensive awareness would address several structural issues. Such a player could relieve the burden on Bruno Fernandes, allowing him to operate higher up the pitch and focus more on chance creation. In defence, injuries to Lisandro Martínez and Raphael Varane have forced Erik ten Hag to constantly shuffle his back line. While Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelöf have stepped in with mixed results, the lack of a left-footed centre-back affects United’s build-up patterns. Depth at full-back is also a concern, particularly on the left, where Luke Shaw has endured recurring fitness problems. Financial constraints and squad registration limits mean United must be selective. Outgoings may be necessary to fund incomings, with fringe players potentially made available for transfer or loan moves. Ten Hag has played down expectations of major January upheaval but acknowledged that “opportunities will be considered if they help the team immediately.” For supporters, meaningful additions in key areas would signal a clear plan to stabilise performances. Whether United can secure the right profile of players mid-season remains to be seen. But if they are to mount a serious challenge for Champions League qualification, strengthening midfield control and defensive depth appears essential.",

      "content": "Virgil van Dijk’s performances this season have been a major factor in Liverpool’s renewed defensive resilience. After a challenging period marked by injuries and fluctuating form, the Dutch defender appears close to his commanding best, anchoring a back line that has conceded fewer goals than in recent campaigns. Van Dijk’s aerial dominance and positional sense are well documented, but his leadership has been particularly notable. With Liverpool integrating new midfielders and rotating full-backs due to fitness issues, his ability to organise and communicate has been vital. Against Newcastle and Spurs, Van Dijk’s anticipation allowed Liverpool to maintain a relatively high line while limiting clear-cut chances. He continues to excel in one-on-one situations, often steering attackers away from goal rather than diving into risky challenges. Statistically, Van Dijk ranks near the top in aerial duels won and clearances per 90 minutes among Premier League centre-backs. More subtly, Liverpool’s improved defensive structure in set-piece situations reflects his influence in positioning and marking assignments. Manager Jürgen Klopp has praised Van Dijk’s “calm authority,” describing him as a reference point for younger defenders such as Jarell Quansah. The presence of Ibrahima Konaté alongside him has also been beneficial, providing mobility and aggression that complement Van Dijk’s reading of the game. With Liverpool aiming to sustain a title challenge, keeping Van Dijk fit and in form will be crucial. His performances provide a platform for the team’s attacking players to operate with confidence, knowing the defence behind them is stable. After a period in which some questioned whether he could return to his previous levels, Van Dijk’s response has been emphatic. His leadership and consistency once again make him one of the Premier League’s standout defenders.",

      "content": "Cole Palmer’s emergence as a central creative force has been one of the standout stories of Chelsea’s season. Signed from Manchester City in the summer, the 21-year-old has quickly become integral to Mauricio Pochettino’s attacking plans, delivering goals, assists, and composure in high-pressure situations. Operating primarily as a right-sided attacker or central playmaker, Palmer offers versatility and intelligence. His first touch and close control allow him to evade pressure, while his vision and passing range open up defences. He has also demonstrated calmness from the penalty spot, converting several crucial spot-kicks. Palmer’s understanding with Nicolas Jackson and Raheem Sterling is growing, with the trio frequently interchanging positions to disrupt opposition marking schemes. When Palmer drifts inside, he creates overloads in central areas, enabling Chelsea’s full-backs to push high and provide width. Beyond traditional statistics, Palmer’s impact can be seen in Chelsea’s improved ability to retain possession in the final third. His willingness to receive the ball in tight spaces and recycle intelligently has helped reduce the number of rushed, low-percentage crosses that plagued the team last season. Pochettino has praised Palmer’s mentality, noting his willingness to take responsibility in key moments. That confidence, combined with technical quality, has endeared him to supporters looking for a new talisman. Chelsea will be cautious not to place too much burden on a young player, but early signs suggest Palmer can handle the expectation. If his development continues on the current trajectory, he could become a long-term cornerstone of Chelsea’s rebuilding project and a regular figure in the conversation around the league’s most influential young attackers.",

      "content": "A closer look at advanced goalkeeping metrics this season highlights the contrasting strengths of Manchester City’s Ederson and Liverpool’s Alisson Becker—two of the Premier League’s most influential goalkeepers in very different ways. Ederson remains central to City’s build-up play. His passing accuracy under pressure and ability to find teammates beyond the first pressing line are unmatched. City frequently use him as an additional outfield player, allowing centre-backs to split wide and full-backs to push higher. Statistically, Ederson completes a high volume of long passes with impressive accuracy, often triggering counter-attacking opportunities. His involvement reduces the number of high-risk passes played by City’s deeper midfielders, contributing to their control. Alisson, by contrast, excels most clearly in shot-stopping and one-on-one situations. Liverpool’s aggressive defensive line and pressing style naturally expose him to more transitional chances. His reflexes and positioning have repeatedly prevented clear scoring opportunities, as seen in recent matches against Tottenham and Newcastle. Post-shot expected goals metrics indicate that Alisson has saved significantly more goals than an average goalkeeper would be expected to, underlining his importance in preserving points. Ederson, while occasionally criticised for individual errors, benefits from City’s ability to limit the quantity and quality of shots faced. Both goalkeepers contribute decisively to their teams’ title ambitions, albeit through different profiles. Ederson’s distribution underpins City’s positional dominance, while Alisson’s shot-stopping and sweeping allow Liverpool to maintain their high-risk, high-reward approach. As the title race unfolds, their performances in key moments—whether a pinpoint pass to initiate an attack or a crucial save in a tight game—could be decisive in determining where the trophy ends up in May.",

      "content": "West Ham’s 1-0 defeat to Arsenal once again highlighted the team’s ongoing search for a reliable, long-term centre-forward option. While David Moyes’ side remains competitive and well-structured, the lack of a consistent goalscorer is becoming increasingly evident in tight matches. Michail Antonio, long a key figure in West Ham’s attack, has battled injuries and inconsistency. His ability to run channels and hold up play remains valuable, but his output has declined. Summer signing options have yet to fully convince, leaving Moyes to alternate between different profiles without finding an ideal fit. Against Arsenal, West Ham’s game plan was clear: remain compact, absorb pressure, and attack through quick transitions. Jarrod Bowen and Mohammed Kudus provided threat from wide and half-space positions, but the absence of a focal point in the penalty area limited their ability to convert promising situations. Statistically, West Ham rank mid-table for expected goals but lag behind in actual goals scored. This disparity suggests that finishing efficiency—and perhaps the quality of chances created centrally—needs improvement. Moyes has acknowledged the issue, hinting that recruitment in the next two windows will prioritise a centre-forward capable of both linking play and scoring regularly. Finding such a player at a realistic price, however, remains challenging. For now, West Ham will continue to rely on a collective attacking effort, with Bowen, Kudus, and set-piece specialists like James Ward-Prowse sharing the goal-scoring burden. But if the club aspires to cement itself as a regular European contender, resolving the centre-forward question will be critical.",

With several key players attracting interest from bigger clubs, sporting director and recruitment staff are already identifying possible replacements to sustain Roberto De Zerbi’s possession-based style. Brighton’s model is built on discovering undervalued talent from less-scouted markets and developing them into high-level performers. Recent seasons have seen successful transitions from one midfield core to another, but the process becomes more challenging as expectations rise. The current midfield blend of ball-winning, press resistance, and progressive passing is central to De Zerbi’s system. Any incoming players must be comfortable receiving under pressure, rotating positions fluidly, and contributing to both build-up and counter-pressing. Data-driven scouting and detailed video analysis have been the club’s hallmark, identifying profiles who fit stylistic requirements rather than solely focusing on reputation. However, as Brighton compete in a more demanding environment, the margin for error narrows. Supporters will be keen to see how the club balances short-term performance with long-term planning. While departures may be inevitable given Brighton’s business model, the track record of successful replacements offers cautious optimism. If the next wave of midfield acquisitions can adapt quickly, Brighton will be well-placed to remain competitive in the top half of the Premier League.

      "content": "A growing number of mid-table Premier League clubs are using sophisticated pressing traps to disrupt the big six, narrowing the gap in individual quality with collective tactical organisation. Wolves, Brentford, and Fulham are among the sides implementing systems designed to funnel play into pre-determined zones before launching rapid transitions. These teams often begin in a mid-block, allowing opponents to progress into seemingly comfortable areas. The trap is sprung when opposition full-backs or deep midfielders receive sideways passes near the touchline. Nearby players then collapse on the ball carrier, cutting off passing lanes and forcing turnovers. Wolves’ approach under Gary O’Neil is a prime example. They frequently invite passes into wide areas before aggressively pressing with three players, aiming to create immediate numerical superiority. Once possession is won, they attack quickly through runners like Matheus Cunha and Pedro Neto. Brentford use a similar concept but with added emphasis on aerial duels and second balls. Their pressing traps are often linked to long goal-kicks or high balls into the channels, where they back their physicality and organisation to win key battles. Fulham, meanwhile, have refined their triggers around João Palhinha’s ball-winning ability. His reading of the game allows Fulham to compress space at the right moment, turning seemingly safe passes into risky ones. For the big six, these tactical patterns pose new challenges. Possession must be more purposeful, with better spacing and awareness of pressure cues. Traditional dominance through ball retention is no longer guaranteed. As analytics and coaching standards continue to rise, pressing traps will likely become even more prevalent. For mid-table sides seeking to bridge the gap without matching financial power, intelligent collective organisation remains one of the most effective tools available.",

Having initially invested significantly to lift the club away from the bottom of the table, the focus has now turned to refining the squad and navigating financial regulations. Sporting director and recruitment staff have prioritised players who combine immediate impact with long-term upside. Signings like Bruno Guimarães and Alexander Isak exemplified this approach, offering quality while fitting into a clear tactical plan under Eddie Howe. However, as expectations rise and the club balances Premier League and European commitments, the margin for error in recruitment tightens. Injuries this season have exposed depth concerns in key positions, particularly in central defence and midfield. Newcastle must also remain mindful of profit and sustainability rules, limiting the scope for large net spends every window. That reality places a premium on accurate scouting, squad planning, and timing of sales. Howe has indicated that character and work ethic remain as important as technical ability, given the intensity of the playing style he demands. Newcastle’s ability to maintain a cohesive dressing room while gradually upgrading positions will be crucial.

Ollie Watkins remains the focal point, supported by the dynamic runs of Moussa Diaby and the creativity of John McGinn and Douglas Luiz. Tottenham, under Ange Postecoglou, continue to embrace an expansive style built around a high defensive line and aggressive possession. Son Heung-min has thrived in a central role, while James Maddison’s influence as a playmaker remains crucial when fit. Tactically, the game may be decided by how well each side manages space in transition. Villa’s ability to spring forward quickly could punish Spurs’ high line, particularly if Watkins and Diaby can time their runs effectively. Conversely, Tottenham’s fluid front line will test Villa’s defensive structure, especially in wide areas. Set pieces could also play a role.

Before Toney’s comeback, Brentford leaned heavily on collective pressing, wide overloads, and set-piece dominance to generate chances. With Toney back, they regain a forward capable of both finishing and linking play, but Frank has stressed the need for balance. In recent matches, Brentford have used Toney as a focal point for build-up, inviting him to drop between the lines to connect with advancing midfielders. His ability to hold the ball under pressure allows Brentford to push their wide players higher, creating opportunities for cut-backs and late runs into the box. At the same time, Frank has encouraged variety. Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo continue to offer direct threat from wide and central areas, ensuring defenders cannot simply crowd Toney. The result is a more unpredictable attack that retains Brentford’s trademark intensity. From a statistical perspective, Brentford’s expected goals have risen since Toney’s reintroduction, while set-piece output remains strong. Opponents now face the dual challenge of dealing with aerial threat from dead balls and a technically proficient centre-forward in open play. If Toney can maintain fitness and form, Brentford’s prospects of a comfortable mid-table finish—or even another push towards the top half—will be significantly enhanced. For the player himself, consistent performances could reignite interest from bigger clubs in future windows, adding another layer of intrigue to Brentford’s planning.",

Defensive solidity will be central to their hopes, particularly against a Wolves side that has found increasing success through quick transitions and wide attacks. Everton’s back line has been inconsistent this season, alternating between compact, disciplined performances and games where individual errors and poor organisation have been punished. James Tarkowski and Jarrad Branthwaite provide aerial strength, but gaps between full-backs and centre-backs have been exploited too often. Manager Graham Potter has worked on tightening distances between the lines, encouraging a more cohesive mid-block rather than relentless pressing. The aim is to reduce space in central areas, forcing opponents to play into wider zones where Everton can funnel play and contest crosses. Against Wolves, the challenge will be containing runners like Matheus Cunha and Pedro Neto, who thrive when given space to drive at defenders. Everton’s midfielders will need to track transitions diligently, preventing Wolves from isolating defenders in one-on-one situations. In possession, Everton will look to use Dwight McNeil and Jack Harrison to stretch the pitch, providing service to Dominic Calvert-Lewin or Beto. Set pieces could be another avenue for goals, with Tarkowski posing a significant threat from corners and free-kicks. Three points would provide a valuable boost in both the table and confidence.

      "content": "Manchester City’s latest 2-1 win over Brighton offered another glimpse into Pep Guardiola’s constant willingness to tweak his side’s structure. This time, the adjustment came in the shape of a subtly altered box midfield, designed to restore control in central areas while refreshing patterns that opponents have begun to anticipate. City lined up nominally in a 4-3-3 but morphed into a 3-2-4-1 in possession. John Stones frequently stepped into midfield alongside Rodri, forming the base of the box, while Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva occupied the advanced pockets between Brighton’s lines. The effect was to overwhelm Brighton’s double pivot and create numerical superiority in central zones. The key change from earlier iterations was the freedom afforded to Foden. Rather than staying predominantly on the left, he drifted across the width of the pitch, looking for overloads near the ball. This caused repeated indecision for Brighton’s midfielders, who were unsure whether to track him or hold their positions. Erling Haaland benefited from these movements, making diagonal runs into channels vacated by defenders drawn out by City’s fluid rotations. Although he scored only once, his constant presence stretched Brighton’s back line and created room for late arrivals from midfield. Defensively, the box structure helped City compress the centre when possession was lost. With Stones and Rodri in close proximity, second balls were recovered quickly, denying Brighton a platform for counter-attacks. It was not flawless, but the overall control levels were closer to City’s usual standards. Guardiola downplayed the significance of the tweak after the match, insisting it was simply a response to Brighton’s shape. However, it fits within a broader pattern of the manager seeking new solutions in a league where opponents have become increasingly familiar with City’s principles. As the title race tightens, these marginal adjustments could prove critical. If City can marry tactical freshness with their customary consistency, they remain well placed to challenge Arsenal and Liverpool deep into the season. For now, the latest version of the box midfield appears another effective tool in Guardiola’s extensive repertoire, underlining why City continue to set the benchmark for tactical innovation in the Premier League.",

Against Everton’s press, his composure and passing range allowed Arsenal to bypass the first line with relative ease. Once the ball entered the opposition half, Rice often pushed forward to become a third man in combinations, particularly on the left side with Gabriel Martinelli and Oleksandr Zinchenko. His late arrivals at the edge of the box created additional shooting threats and second-ball security. Defensively, Rice remains the anchor. His reading of transitions has been crucial to Arsenal’s improved stability. When moves broke down, he was usually in position to stop counters at source, allowing the rest of the team to recover. Arteta has spoken about Rice’s capacity to interpret different roles within the same game. The manager has used him as a single pivot, as part of a double pivot, and even as an advanced number eight in certain game states. That versatility gives Arsenal more in-game options than in previous seasons. Statistical indicators back up Rice’s importance. He ranks highly for ball recoveries, progressive passes and pressures in the middle third among Premier League midfielders. Perhaps most importantly, his presence has allowed Arsenal to maintain a higher defensive line with greater security. As the season progresses, it would be no surprise to see Rice’s responsibilities continue to expand. Whether protecting leads, chasing games or controlling tempo, he has quickly become the player around whom much of Arsenal’s tactical planning revolves. In a title race where small details make big differences, Rice’s adaptability may prove one of Arsenal’s most significant advantages.",

      "content": "Manchester United’s 3-1 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield reignited debate around Erik ten Hag’s insistence on playing out from the back under intense pressure. While the approach aligns with his long-term vision, the latest setback showed how United’s current structure and personnel remain vulnerable when facing elite pressing sides. United repeatedly attempted to construct attacks through short passes from Andre Onana to their centre-backs. Liverpool responded with aggressive, man-oriented pressing, using Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah to close down passing lanes while midfielders jumped onto Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes. On several occasions, United’s attempts to maintain composure led to dangerous turnovers inside their own third. The second goal they conceded stemmed from a misplaced pass into midfield, immediately punished by Liverpool’s rapid combination play. Ten Hag defended the strategy post-match, arguing that United need to persist with their principles if they are to progress. However, critics point to a lack of structural support around the ball. Full-backs were often too high, leaving limited short options, while midfielders struggled to create angles under pressure. There were glimpses of the upside. When United did beat the press, they were able to attack space quickly, with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho threatening on the break. Yet these moments were too sporadic to outweigh the risk taken at the other end. The question is whether United’s current squad is suited to such a high-risk approach in every fixture. Some analysts suggest a more pragmatic variation may be needed against the league’s most intense pressing teams, at least until automatic relationships become more ingrained. For now, the debate will continue. Ten Hag’s commitment to a proactive style is clear, but until results match ambition in fixtures like this, scrutiny around the balance between ideology and practicality is unlikely to diminish.",

      "content": "Son Heung-min’s transition into a more central attacking role has been pivotal in maintaining Tottenham’s attacking output following the departure of their previous talisman. Under Ange Postecoglou, Son has been used primarily as a central striker rather than a left-sided forward, and the Korean international has responded with a series of decisive performances. The change has not been without challenges. Playing centrally demands different movements and physical battles, particularly against deep, compact defences. Yet Son’s intelligent runs and instinctive finishing have translated effectively. In Tottenham’s 2-1 victory over West Ham, Son showcased the range of his new role. For the opening goal, he dropped short to combine with James Maddison, helping draw centre-backs out of position. Moments later, he burst in behind to latch onto a through-ball, finishing calmly. His link-up play has been equally important. Son often drifts into half-spaces, allowing wingers and full-backs to occupy the wide channels. This creates fluid rotations that make Spurs difficult to track. Defensively, his work rate remains high. Postecoglou’s pressing scheme requires the central forward to initiate pressure, and Son’s timing has been crucial in forcing opponents into hurried clearances. Statistically, Son’s shot locations have become more central and closer to goal, contributing to a higher expected goals figure. While his total shot volume has remained similar, the quality of chances has improved. Postecoglou has praised Son’s willingness to adapt, describing him as the ideal leader for a young, evolving squad. Supporters, meanwhile, have embraced his new role, seeing in him a figure who combines familiarity with fresh responsibility. If he continues at this level, Son’s reinvention could be one of the defining stories of Tottenham’s season and a key factor in their push for Champions League qualification.",

      "content": "Arsenal’s comfortable 3-0 win over Bournemouth was overshadowed by an injury to Bukayo Saka, raising immediate questions about Mikel Arteta’s options on the right flank. Saka, who has been remarkably durable over the past three seasons, limped off midway through the second half with what appeared to be a muscle problem. The extent of the injury is yet to be fully determined, but even a short-term absence would pose a significant test. Saka is central not just to Arsenal’s chance creation but also to their pressing structure, often leading the press from the right and triggering defensive actions. In his place, Arteta turned to Leandro Trossard, who provided a different type of threat. The Belgian’s preference for drifting inside opened up space for Ben White to overlap more aggressively. While this brought immediate attacking benefits, it also changed Arsenal’s balance out of possession. Should Saka miss several matches, Arteta will need to decide whether to maintain the same structural patterns with different personnel, or tweak the system. Options include deploying Trossard or Gabriel Jesus wide, or giving more minutes to Reiss Nelson. Each brings distinct strengths. Trossard offers combination play and unpredictability; Jesus contributes pressing intensity and dribbling; Nelson adds direct pace. None, however, replicate the precise blend of ball-carrying, decision-making and end product that Saka provides. Arsenal’s recruitment has been praised for raising the squad’s overall level, but this scenario will reveal how well genuine depth has been built in key positions. With crucial fixtures ahead, including meetings with direct rivals in the top four, managing Saka’s workload and his potential absence could be a decisive storyline. For now, Arsenal will hope the injury proves minor. If not, their adaptability without one of the league’s standout wide forwards will come sharply into focus.",

      "content": "Liverpool and Arsenal sit near the top of the Premier League table, and both use high pressing as a core part of their identity. However, a closer tactical comparison reveals notable differences in how Jürgen Klopp and Mikel Arteta implement their pressing schemes. Liverpool’s press remains rooted in intensity and verticality. The front three often shift in unison to force play toward one flank, with the midfield line pushing high to compress space. The objective is to regain the ball quickly and attack directly. Arsenal, by contrast, press with a stronger emphasis on positional control. Their first line commonly blocks central passes, inviting opponents into structured traps rather than immediately charging the ball carrier. Once the pass is played, nearby players converge to limit options. Statistical data shows both teams among the league leaders in high turnovers per match, but with different profiles. Liverpool generate more turnovers in wider areas, reflecting their strategy of channelling opponents toward the touchline. Arsenal create more in central zones, consistent with their focus on blocking vertical lanes. In transition, Liverpool are more direct. When possession is won, forwards often make immediate runs in behind, aiming to exploit disorganised defences. Arsenal sometimes choose to recycle and rebuild, using the regained possession to maintain territorial control. These differences reflect the managers’ broader philosophies. Klopp still leans toward chaos and energy, trusting his side’s physicality and mentality. Arteta seeks control and repeatable patterns, aiming to minimise randomness. Both approaches can succeed, as the current table indicates. The question for the rest of the season is which model proves more robust under the pressure of a tight title race, and how each side handles inevitable fluctuations in form and fitness. Their upcoming head-to-head meetings will provide further insight, offering a fascinating clash between two refined versions of high pressing football at the highest level.",

      "content": "Chelsea’s long-term recruitment planning is increasingly focused on securing a specialist defensive midfielder, with coaching staff believing such a signing could unlock greater balance across the team. While Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez are both high-profile additions, the current blend in midfield has yet to fully stabilise. In recent matches, Mauricio Pochettino has alternated between a double pivot and a single holding player in front of the back four. Caicedo’s energy and ball-winning are clear assets, but his positioning can still be inconsistent as he adapts to new responsibilities. Enzo, meanwhile, offers progression and creativity but is not naturally inclined to remain deep for prolonged periods. When both push forward simultaneously, Chelsea can be exposed to transitions, forcing centre-backs into difficult decisions. Pochettino has occasionally used Conor Gallagher to add extra defensive coverage, but that solution is not permanent. The sense within the club is that a true specialist, comfortable screening the defence and orchestrating build-up from deep, would give more freedom to creative players ahead. Data analysis and scouting are reportedly centred on profiles who combine mobility, anticipation and passing range. The challenge will be finding someone who complements Caicedo and Enzo while fitting within financial and squad-building constraints. Until then, Pochettino must continue to manage the balance game by game, adjusting structures depending on the opposition. Chelsea’s attack is gradually clicking into place, but without a fully secure base, their margin for error remains slim. If the right player arrives in the summer, it could be the final piece that transforms promising performances into consistent results, and moves Chelsea closer to the level their ambitions demand.",

      "content": "One of Manchester City’s enduring strengths under Pep Guardiola has been the quality of their bench, and this season is no different. A series of tight matches have been decided by second-half substitutions, underlining the impact of tactical changes and squad depth. In the 2-1 win over Spurs, Jeremy Doku’s introduction on the hour shifted the game’s momentum. His direct dribbling forced Tottenham’s defensive line deeper, creating more space for City’s midfielders to operate. Similarly, against Newcastle, the introduction of Julian Alvarez provided fresh energy and a different forward profile. His willingness to drop into midfield created overloads that Newcastle struggled to track, culminating in the winning goal. Guardiola has spoken about using the bench not just to rest players but to change the dynamic of matches. His substitutions often involve altering the structure, such as moving from a traditional back four to a three-at-the-back system, or adding an extra midfielder to gain control. Statistical analysis shows City score a high proportion of their goals after the 60th minute, a period when tactical changes and opponent fatigue intersect. While this is not unique to City, it illustrates how effectively they exploit late-game scenarios. Opponents face the challenge of dealing with not only City’s starting XI but also a second wave of technically gifted, tactically flexible players. For title rivals with smaller squads, replicating that capacity is difficult. As the season wears on and physical tiredness increases, the influence of City’s bench could grow even more significant. In a title race that may hinge on fine margins, the ability to consistently change games from the sidelines remains one of their key advantages.",

      "content": "As the Premier League campaign nears its midway point, advanced metrics provide a clearer picture of the relegation battle. While the table offers a snapshot, underlying numbers such as expected goals, shot quality and defensive errors reveal which clubs may be in deeper trouble than their current position suggests. Sheffield United sit bottom and also rank poorly in most metrics. They concede high volumes of shots from central areas and create relatively few high-quality chances. Their expected goal difference per game is significantly negative, indicating that their struggles are not simply down to bad luck. Nottingham Forest and Southampton also feature in the danger zone. Forest concede more chances on quick transitions than any other side, a reflection of their difficulties in securing midfield control. Southampton, meanwhile, dominate possession in many matches but lack cutting edge in the final third. Everton’s situation is more complex. On paper, their expected goals and expected goals against suggest a mid-table side. However, individual errors and lapses of concentration have cost them crucial points. If such mistakes are reduced, there is scope for improvement in results. Crystal Palace and Bournemouth appear slightly more secure, but both are only a poor run away from trouble. Palace’s defensive metrics remain decent, yet their attacking numbers are among the lowest in the league. Bournemouth have improved under Andoni Iraola, particularly in pressing and chance creation, though defensive solidity is still evolving. The key takeaway is that, beyond Sheffield United, no side is cut adrift in performance terms. Small changes in finishing, set-piece efficiency or injury fortunes could dramatically impact the final standings. For managers under pressure, these numbers offer both warning signs and potential grounds for optimism. The battle to avoid the drop looks set to be as tightly contested as the race at the top, with data suggesting twists still to come.",

      "content": "A key trend emerging this Premier League season is the role of transition speed in separating Europe-chasing sides from the rest. Teams like Aston Villa, Newcastle and Tottenham are thriving by turning defensive moments into attacking opportunities within a few passes. Aston Villa, under Unai Emery, have become specialists at attacking quickly once the ball is regained. Ollie Watkins and Moussa Diaby lead sharp vertical moves, supported by midfielders arriving from deeper positions. Villa’s average time from ball recovery to shot is among the shortest in the division. Tottenham’s high-risk approach under Ange Postecoglou also emphasises rapid transitions. When they win the ball, they look immediately to exploit spaces behind opposition full-backs, with Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski making diagonal runs. Newcastle, even amid injury issues, continue to rely on high-intensity transitions. Anthony Gordon and Miguel Almiron offer direct dribbling threats, while full-backs push forward to provide width. In contrast, several mid-table clubs progress the ball more slowly after regaining possession, prioritising control over speed. While this reduces the risk of immediate turnovers, it also allows opponents to reset their defensive shape. Analysts note that the most effective transition sides combine fitness, coordinated running and clear patterns of play. It is not simply about sprinting forward but knowing where space is likely to appear and which passing lanes to target. As the season develops, transition speed will continue to be a decisive factor in tight games, especially against teams that commit many players forward. Those who master it will retain a valuable edge in the race for European places.",

      "content": "Bruno Fernandes remains at the heart of Manchester United’s attacking play, but his role continues to generate debate. The Portuguese midfielder’s inclination towards risk-taking passes fuels United’s creativity, yet it also raises questions about balance and control in tight matches. Fernandes leads United in key passes, through-balls and chances created, underlining his importance in unlocking defences. His ability to play early, penetrative passes suits United’s preference for quick transitions. However, his high volume of attempted riskier passes inevitably results in turnovers. When United lack a stable defensive structure behind him, these moments can expose them to counter-attacks. Erik ten Hag faces a tactical balancing act. Restricting Fernandes too heavily could blunt United’s attack, but granting him unrestricted freedom sometimes leaves the team stretched. The manager has experimented with different midfield partners and shapes to manage this dynamic. Playing Fernandes slightly wider at times has allowed United to press more effectively in certain games, while positioning him closer to the striker increases his goal threat. Each adjustment comes with trade-offs elsewhere. Statistics show that even with a relatively high turnover rate, Fernandes remains one of the league’s most productive creative players. For United, the challenge is to build a structure robust enough to absorb the inherent risk of his style. If they succeed, Fernandes can remain the hub of an attack capable of troubling any defence. If not, calls for a recalibration of his responsibilities will continue whenever results dip. For now, he remains both United’s primary solution in the final third and a focal point in discussions about how the team should evolve tactically.",

The club’s approach is built on aligning academy and senior team playing styles. Young players are schooled in similar pressing triggers, positional play and build-up patterns, allowing smoother transitions when they step up. Quansah’s performances at centre-back have been particularly encouraging. Comfortable on the ball and composed under pressure, he has shown he can fit into Liverpool’s high defensive line and possession game. Bradley and Doak, meanwhile, provide energetic options in wide areas. Their introductions in cup competitions and selected league matches offer rest for senior players while giving the youngsters valuable experience. Klopp has repeatedly stressed that opportunities must be earned, not granted. But the visibility of a genuine route to the first team serves as motivation for academy players and a recruitment advantage for the club. In a market where elite-ready signings are increasingly expensive, the ability to promote from within is invaluable. Liverpool will still invest in established players, yet supplementing that with homegrown options gives the squad greater depth and identity.

Arsenal’s Oleksandr Zinchenko continues to stand out for his role as an auxiliary midfielder. He ranks highly in progressive passes and touches in central zones, reflecting his tendency to invert and dictate tempo. Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold remains among the league leaders in chance creation from wide areas. His switch to an occasional hybrid midfield role has increased his involvement in build-up while maintaining his crossing threat. On the opposite flank, Andrew Robertson’s injury has given more minutes to Kostas Tsimikas, whose crossing numbers are strong but whose defensive metrics, particularly in one-on-one duels, still lag slightly behind Robertson’s. Manchester City’s Kyle Walker and Josko Gvardiol offer a contrasting profile. Walker provides recovery pace and defensive stability, while Gvardiol, often used as a left-back who tucks inside, contributes to City’s fluid build-up structure. At Chelsea, Reece James’ fitness remains a concern, but when available he ranks near the top for progressive carries and defensive duels won. Malo Gusto has impressed as a deputy, suggesting Chelsea have long-term depth at the position. Advanced metrics such as expected assisted goals, progressive carries and defensive interventions highlight how integral full-backs are to modern systems.

Villa Park has become a venue where visiting teams struggle to escape with points, thanks to a combination of tactical structure, atmosphere and game management. Emery has tailored Villa’s approach to maximise home advantage. The team presses higher and more aggressively, encouraged by a crowd that responds to intensity. Early pressure often leads to turnovers in advanced areas, setting the tone for the rest of the match. In possession, Villa use width and quick switches of play to stretch opponents. Ollie Watkins’ movement, combined with the dynamic runs of Moussa Diaby and overlapping full-backs, forces defensive lines to constantly adjust. Villa also manage game states well. When leading, they are willing to slow tempo and invite pressure, confident in their ability to defend the box and counter-attack. Douglas Luiz and Boubacar Kamara play key roles in controlling central spaces. Set pieces have further enhanced their advantage. Villa rank highly for goals from corners and indirect free-kicks, with centre-backs Pau Torres and Ezri Konsa frequent targets. The psychological aspect should not be underestimated.

Over recent weeks, however, there has been a noticeable evolution in their build-up play, allowing the Cherries to combine aggression with greater control. Initially, Bournemouth often looked rushed when playing out from the back. Vertical passes into crowded areas led to turnovers and counter-attacks. While their pressing remained effective, the team struggled to turn regained possession into sustained attacks. Iraola and his staff have since implemented more structured patterns. Centre-backs now have clearer passing options into a dropping defensive midfielder, while full-backs time their advances more carefully. The result is a smoother progression through the thirds. Dominic Solanke benefits from receiving service higher up the pitch, while wide players can attack more favourable one-on-one situations. Statistically, Bournemouth’s pass completion in their own half has improved, and they are losing the ball less in dangerous central zones. At the same time, their high press remains intact, keeping opponents uncomfortable. There is still work to be done, particularly in turning possession into consistent high-quality chances. Yet the tactical direction is evident, and performances have stabilised as a result.

From corners to throw-ins, dedicated staff are reshaping how teams approach moments that can decide tight games. Arsenal’s improvement under set-piece coach Nicolas Jover is one of the clearest examples. The Gunners have gone from average in this area to one of the most threatening sides, using rehearsed routines that frequently free up their aerial threats. Other clubs have followed suit. Brentford devote significant training time to choreographed movements, while teams like Liverpool and Manchester City employ analysts focused specifically on set-piece design and opposition tendencies. Data supports this emphasis. An increasing share of Premier League goals come from dead-ball situations, particularly in matches where open-play chances are limited by well-organised defences. Set-piece coaches work closely with analysts and fitness staff, ensuring routines are both tactically sound and physically executable. They tailor plans to player profiles, using some as decoys and others as primary targets. Defensively, the role is equally important. Tracking opposition trends, adjusting marking schemes and rehearsing clearances all fall within their remit. As the league becomes more tactically sophisticated, set-piece details can be the difference between mid-table and European qualification, or between survival and relegation.

When the first line is bypassed or slightly mistimed, large spaces appear between defence and goalkeeper. Injuries have played a part. The absence of key defenders and midfield screeners has disrupted communication and timing. Howe has acknowledged that without full physical and tactical sharpness, such an aggressive line carries increased risk. Adjustments may be necessary, at least temporarily. Dropping a few yards deeper in certain games, or switching to a back three, could provide more security while retaining elements of Newcastle’s proactive identity. Supporters appreciate the bold approach that has taken the club back towards European contention, but recent setbacks highlight the fine margins involved. Howe’s next steps will be closely watched.

Manager Oliver Glasner has attempted to position them in roles that maximise their strengths, often allowing one to operate between the lines while the other holds width. The challenge has been maintaining compactness and defensive stability when both are given such freedom. Opponents increasingly focus on denying them space, doubling up when they receive the ball. Palace need more support runs and alternative threats to prevent their star duo from being crowded out. If Eze and Olise can stay fit and find sustained form, Palace’s prospects improve considerably. Their ability to decide games with individual moments remains a valuable asset in tight encounters. For now, the aim will be to turn sporadic influence into regular, match-winning contributions, providing the spark Palace need to move away from the lower reaches of the table.",

      "content": "As the Premier League season moves towards its decisive months, the psychological aspect of the title race becomes more prominent. Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City are not only competing on tactical and technical fronts, but also in how they handle the growing pressure. Sports psychologists working with top clubs emphasise routine, communication and focus on controllable factors. Players are encouraged to treat each match identically, regardless of the narrative around it. Leaders within squads play a crucial role. Figures like Virgil van Dijk, Martin Odegaard and Rodri set emotional tones in dressing rooms, guiding younger players through high-pressure scenarios. Coaches also manage external noise, limiting the extent to which players engage with social media and media narratives. The aim is to keep attention on preparation and performance rather than permutations of league tables. Past experiences matter. City’s history of navigating tight title races gives them a reference point, while Liverpool and Arsenal draw on their own recent campaigns, learning from both successes and near misses. Ultimately, the mental side intersects with tactical preparation. Teams that trust their game model and feel prepared for different scenarios often cope better with pressure, relying on habits rather than improvisation. With fine margins likely to decide the race, the club that balances emotional intensity with composure may gain a subtle but crucial edge in the run-in.",

      "content": "As clubs begin to plan their next recruitment cycles, several midfielders outside the traditional big six are emerging as potential targets. Their performances this season have drawn attention from scouts seeking players capable of stepping into Champions League-level squads. Fulham’s Joao Palhinha continues to be widely admired for his ball-winning and physical presence. He leads the league in tackles per 90 minutes and offers a blend of aggression and positional discipline that many top sides value. At Wolves, Joao Gomes has impressed with his energy and ability to break lines with both passes and carries. His age profile and adaptability make him an intriguing option for clubs looking for long-term solutions. Brighton’s latest midfield cohort includes technically secure, press-resistant players comfortable in complex build-up structures. Their track record of developing such profiles means scouts pay close attention to performances at the Amex. Brentford’s dynamic midfielders also feature on many lists, capable of covering ground and executing detailed tactical plans. Their success in a data-driven recruitment model adds an extra layer of confidence for potential suitors. Any moves, however, will depend on valuation and timing. Selling clubs are in strong negotiating positions, aware that Premier League rivals have significant resources and specific needs. For now, these players remain focused on their current campaigns. But as the next windows approach, their names are likely to feature heavily in discussions about how the big six refresh and reinforce their midfield options for future title and European pushes.",

      "content": "Arsenal’s 2-0 victory over Newcastle once again showcased the importance of their left-side triangle, with Gabriel Martinelli, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Declan Rice combining to dominate that flank. While much of the attention understandably falls on Bukayo Saka on the right, it is the interplay on the opposite side that often determines how effectively Arsenal control matches. From the outset at the Emirates, Arsenal targeted Newcastle’s right-back channel. Zinchenko stepped into midfield in the first phase, creating a 3-2 structure that allowed Arsenal to outnumber Newcastle’s first line of pressure. Rice frequently slid across to provide cover, ensuring that any transition threat was quickly extinguished. Martinelli’s movement was central to the approach. Rather than hugging the touchline, he constantly darted into the half-space, forcing Newcastle’s right centre-back into difficult decisions. When he stayed wide, Zinchenko or Rice occupied the inside lane; when he cut infield, the full-back overlapped. The opening goal came from this pattern. Zinchenko moved centrally to receive from Gabriel, drawing Newcastle’s winger inside. Rice then stepped higher, receiving on the turn and immediately releasing Martinelli into the channel. His low cross was converted by Gabriel Jesus at the near post. Defensively, the structure proved equally effective. With Rice covering transitions and Martinelli working hard to track back, Newcastle found little joy attacking that side. Any attempt to switch play was met with a compact, well-organised block. The balance offered by this triangle is one of Arsenal’s most important tactical assets. It provides progression, creativity and defensive protection without compromising the rest of the team’s shape. As the title race intensifies, opponents will continue to search for ways to disrupt Arsenal’s patterns. Shutting down Saka is rarely enough; the left-side combination, driven by the intelligence of Zinchenko and Rice and the direct threat of Martinelli, remains a decisive part of Arteta’s game plan. If they maintain this level of coherence, Arsenal will continue to generate the territorial dominance that has underpinned their surge to the top end of the table.",

      "content": "Liverpool’s 1-0 win away at West Ham provided an intriguing glimpse into how Jürgen Klopp may structure his attack in matches without Mohamed Salah. With the Egyptian absent, Klopp reconfigured his front line, handing Darwin Núñez, Luis Díaz and Diogo Jota the responsibility of carrying the threat. Liverpool’s shape remained a 4-3-3 on paper, but in possession it resembled more of a 2-3-5. Núñez operated as the central reference point, with Díaz holding width on the left and Jota tucking inside from the right to act as an additional striker. The key adjustment came in how Liverpool created overloads. Without Salah’s trademark moves into the right half-space, Trent Alexander-Arnold stepped further forward from his hybrid full-back role, effectively becoming a playmaker in the channel. Jota then rotated between central and wide positions, keeping West Ham’s back line guessing. The winning goal highlighted the new dynamic. Núñez dropped off the front line to link play, drawing a centre-back with him. Alexander-Arnold received the ball in space and slipped a pass through to Jota, whose diagonal run was perfectly timed before finishing low across the goalkeeper. Defensively, Liverpool’s press remained coordinated, but the absence of Salah’s work rate on the right required extra attention from the midfield. Harvey Elliott and Alexis Mac Allister both shifted wider at times to plug gaps when the press was broken. While no single player can replicate Salah’s unique mix of goals, assists and gravity, the performance suggested Liverpool have the tools to remain dangerous in his absence. The interplay of Núñez, Díaz and Jota, supported by Alexander-Arnold’s expanded creative influence, offers a different, more fluid attacking picture. For Klopp, the challenge will be maintaining this cohesion over a longer run of fixtures if required. But the early signs indicate Liverpool can evolve without abandoning the principles that have brought them sustained success.",

      "content": "Manchester United’s 1-1 draw with Brighton at Old Trafford once again highlighted the team’s full-back conundrum. Injuries and form have forced Erik ten Hag into constant reshuffles, and the lack of stability in those positions continues to undermine United’s build-up play. Against Brighton, United started with Diogo Dalot on the right and Victor Lindelöf filling in at left-back. While both performed diligently, the overall structure suffered. Dalot was tasked with providing width higher up the pitch, but this left significant responsibility on the right-sided centre-back to cover transitions. On the opposite flank, Lindelöf offered defensive security but limited forward thrust. As a natural centre-back, his instinct was to stay deeper and narrower, reducing the number of overlapping runs that might have supported Marcus Rashford. In possession, United often struggled to create clean passing lanes from the back. Andre Onana was willing to play into tight spaces, but the movement ahead of him lacked coordination. Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo dropped alternately to assist, yet Brighton’s press forced several rushed clearances. These issues are not purely individual. Ten Hag’s system relies on full-backs who can invert into midfield or overlap aggressively, depending on the game plan. Without consistent personnel, automatisms are difficult to build. The return to full fitness of Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka would provide more natural balance. Shaw’s ability to step into midfield and deliver from wide areas is particularly important for United’s left-sided patterns. For now, the manager must make do with makeshift solutions. The full-back positions have become a microcosm of United’s broader challenges: injuries, tactical ambition and inconsistent execution converging to create a team still searching for a clear, repeatable identity in possession. If they can restore stability in these areas, United’s build-up play should improve, giving their talented forwards a more reliable platform from which to attack.",

      "content": "Chelsea’s 2-0 win over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park was notable not only for the clean sheet but also for the composed display of their young centre-back partnership. Levi Colwill and Benoît Badiashile started together in the heart of defence and provided a glimpse of what could become a long-term foundation for Mauricio Pochettino’s side. From the first whistle, both defenders showed a willingness to step into midfield with the ball. Their passing between the lines helped Chelsea progress through Palace’s compact structure, reducing the burden on the double pivot. Colwill, operating on the left, produced several line-breaking passes into Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernández. Badiashile, meanwhile, combined aerial dominance with controlled aggression in duels against Jean-Philippe Mateta. Defensively, their partnership looked well-balanced. Colwill’s mobility allowed him to cover wider areas when full-backs advanced, while Badiashile anchored the central zones. On the rare occasions Palace threatened from crosses, the pair dealt calmly with the danger. Pochettino has been careful not to overburden his young defenders, frequently rotating with experienced options when fixture congestion demands. However, performances like this strengthen the case for giving the duo extended runs together. The challenge will be maintaining concentration over longer stretches of the season and adapting to different types of opponents. Physical centre-forwards pose one test; mobile, interchanging front lines present another. If they can meet those demands, Chelsea will feel increasingly confident they have found a pairing capable of growing with the project. In a squad undergoing significant change, Colwill and Badiashile offer continuity and upside in a crucial area of the pitch. For supporters, seeing two young defenders handle a tricky away fixture with such maturity will be one of the most encouraging signs of the campaign so far.",

      "content": "Tottenham’s 3-3 draw with Brentford at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium highlighted both the attacking potency and defensive imbalance in Ange Postecoglou’s midfield. While Spurs created enough chances to win comfortably, their openness without the ball allowed Brentford to remain in the contest. Postecoglou selected Yves Bissouma and Pape Matar Sarr as the central pairing, with James Maddison operating ahead as a free number ten. In possession, this structure allowed Spurs to circulate the ball quickly and find passing lanes into the half-spaces. However, when possession was lost, large gaps appeared between midfield and defence. Brentford repeatedly exploited these spaces with direct passes into the channels, forcing centre-backs into one-on-one situations. The absence of a more positionally conservative midfielder was particularly noticeable whenever full-backs pushed high simultaneously. Neither Bissouma nor Sarr consistently held their ground to shield the back line. Some analysts have suggested Postecoglou may need to consider a slight tactical tweak, perhaps by asking one full-back to remain deeper or by using an additional midfielder in tighter games. There is also the option of pairing Bissouma with a more disciplined number six profile, though such a player is arguably not yet present in the squad. January recruitment may address this. Despite the concerns, Spurs’ attacking patterns remain impressive. Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski were constant threats, while Maddison’s creativity again stood out. The task for Postecoglou is to preserve this attacking fluency while reducing the vulnerability of transitions. If he can find the right balance, Tottenham will be well-placed to sustain their push for a top-four finish.",

With injuries and rotation affecting senior players, Pep Guardiola turned to several young talents, who responded with mature performances. Oscar Bobb started on the right wing and provided constant movement between the lines. His ability to drift inside created overloads in midfield, while his link-up play with Phil Foden and Julian Alvarez kept Fulham’s defensive block under stress. In midfield, Rico Lewis once again demonstrated his tactical intelligence, seamlessly stepping from full-back into central areas during build-up. His positioning allowed Rodri to push slightly higher at times, adding a new dimension to City’s ball progression. Even in a brief cameo, teenager Micah Hamilton impressed with his composure, nearly scoring after a sharp one-two on the edge of the box. Guardiola praised the academy graduates afterwards, pointing to their technical foundations and understanding of City’s game model. Years of training within a consistent playing philosophy appear to be bearing fruit. For City, the emergence of these players offers both practical and strategic benefits. They provide depth in a busy season and help the club meet homegrown player requirements. They also reduce the need for short-term signings in certain positions. The challenge will be providing enough minutes for development while still competing on multiple fronts. But on current evidence, City’s academy is no longer just a theoretical part of the project; it is delivering real contributions in meaningful matches. If this trend continues, it will further strengthen City’s position at the pinnacle of English football by ensuring a steady supply of players who are already attuned to the demands of Guardiola’s system.",

      "content": "Manchester United’s inconsistent season has prompted scrutiny of not just performances but also underlying data. While the league table paints a picture of a side struggling to secure a top-four place, some advanced metrics suggest United may be underperforming relative to the chances they create and concede. Expected goals models indicate that United’s expected goal difference is slightly better than their actual record. They are generating a moderate volume of chances while conceding fewer high-quality opportunities than the raw goals against tally might imply. One factor is finishing variance. United have missed several big chances in key matches, most notably through Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Højlund early in the campaign. At the other end, opponents have occasionally scored from low-probability shots, skewing the numbers. Goalkeeping performance has also been mixed. While Andre Onana has made notable saves, high-profile errors in Champions League fixtures have shaped perceptions. In the league, his post-shot expected goals data sits close to average, suggesting neither dramatic underperformance nor overperformance. Defensive errors and lapses in concentration, particularly when protecting leads, have further contributed to dropped points. These moments can be difficult to capture fully in aggregate models. For Erik ten Hag, the data offers both reassurance and a warning. It suggests United are not structurally as weak as some narratives suggest, but also that small margins are costing them dearly. Improved finishing, more consistent line-ups and fewer individual mistakes could see results move closer to underlying performance. However, the club cannot rely on variance alone correcting course; tangible improvements in build-up, pressing and game management remain necessary. The numbers hint that United are a mid-to-upper-table side rather than a crisis team, but bridging the gap to the genuine title contenders will require more than just better luck in front of goal.",

With Luis Díaz, Diogo Jota and Cody Gakpo all capable of operating in that channel, opponents face a different type of threat depending on the selection. Against Villa, Díaz started and provided relentless direct running. His willingness to take on defenders one-versus-one forced Matty Cash into a conservative role, limiting Villa’s ability to attack down that flank. Midway through the second half, Klopp introduced Jota, who offered a more penalty-box-oriented presence. Rather than hugging the touchline, he drifted into central spaces, effectively forming a front two with Darwin Núñez. This rotation created problems for Villa’s centre-backs, who struggled to track Jota’s movements while still monitoring Núñez’s runs in behind. In previous matches, Gakpo has been used as a more connective option, dropping into deeper pockets to link with midfield. Each profile gives Liverpool different tactical levers to pull during games. The common thread is the support provided by Andy Robertson or Kostas Tsimikas from left-back. Their overlapping runs and deliveries into the box complement whichever forward is stationed ahead. For opponents, preparing for Liverpool’s left side is becoming increasingly complex. Game plans must account for multiple possibilities, with in-game adjustments likely required as substitutions are made. For Klopp, this variety is a significant asset in a long season. It allows him to rest players, tailor threats to specific opponents and respond dynamically to match scenarios, all while maintaining Liverpool’s trademark intensity and vertical threat.",

Mikel Arteta’s substitutions changed the game, with fresh legs and tactical shifts overwhelming a tiring Wolves side. Trailing heading into the final 20 minutes, Arteta introduced Leandro Trossard and Emile Smith Rowe. Both immediately injected energy and creativity, occupying pockets of space between Wolves’ defence and midfield. Trossard’s versatility allowed him to drift across the front line, creating overloads on either flank. Smith Rowe, meanwhile, found gaps in central areas, linking play and drawing defenders out of position. The equaliser came when Trossard combined with Martin Ødegaard before cutting the ball back from the byline. Minutes later, Smith Rowe’s intelligent movement opened a passing lane for Declan Rice, whose long-range shot took a slight deflection on its way into the net. Beyond individual contributions, the episode highlighted how Arsenal’s squad depth has improved. In previous seasons, the drop-off from the starting XI to bench options was more pronounced; now, Arteta can call upon players capable of maintaining, or even raising, the team’s technical level. Defensively, late introductions of fresh defenders such as Takehiro Tomiyasu have also helped protect leads, adding height and composure in closing stages. As fixtures accumulate, this ability to influence games from the bench will be essential. It allows Arsenal to navigate congested schedules, cope with injuries and maintain intensity for longer periods. If they are to sustain a challenge against the resource-rich squads of Liverpool and Manchester City, contributions from beyond the starting XI may prove decisive.

      "content": "Manchester City’s 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace reopened an old debate among supporters and analysts: should City always prioritise maximum control, or is there room for more chaos to unlock stubborn defences? At the Etihad, City dominated possession and territory but created fewer clear-cut chances than usual. Palace defended in a compact 5-4-1 block, rarely pressing high. City responded by circulating the ball patiently, probing for openings through central combinations. While this approach limited Palace’s transition threat, it also allowed them to maintain their shape. Erling Haaland received few touches in dangerous positions, and City’s wide players often found themselves delivering hopeful crosses against a crowded penalty area. Some argue that introducing more direct elements—earlier crosses, shots from distance, or dribbles into traffic—could increase volatility in such games, potentially forcing mistakes. Pep Guardiola has historically favoured control, trusting that sustained pressure will eventually produce chances. Yet he has also shown a willingness to alter the dynamic with more risky substitutions when required. Against Palace, the introduction of Jeremy Doku and Julian Alvarez did inject urgency, but without the decisive breakthrough. The broader question is whether City’s current iteration, with its emphasis on measured build-up, occasionally needs a jolt of unpredictability. Balancing control and chaos is a challenge at the elite level. Too much of the latter risks exposing the back line; too much of the former can lead to sterile dominance. As the title race tightens, City’s ability to solve low-block problems in different ways could be key. Finding that balance may determine whether draws like this remain isolated frustrations or become a recurring theme.",

      "content": "Brentford’s 0-0 draw with Chelsea at the Gtech Community Stadium was the latest example of Thomas Frank’s side frustrating a top-six opponent with their well-drilled defensive block. While the Bees created little themselves, their compactness and discipline off the ball limited Chelsea to mostly low-quality efforts. Frank set his team up in a 5-3-2 shape without possession, with wing-backs dropping deep to form a back five. The midfield trio stayed narrow, cutting off central passing lanes and encouraging Chelsea to move the ball to wide areas. Once the ball was worked wide, Brentford’s pressing trigger activated. The near-side wing-back and midfielder squeezed the space, while centre-backs were ready to step out if passes were played inside. Chelsea responded by attempting quick combinations through Cole Palmer and Raheem Sterling, but the density of Brentford’s block made it difficult to find gaps. Crosses into the box were largely dealt with by Ethan Pinnock and Ben Mee. Brentford’s approach requires concentration and physical effort, yet the players have clearly internalised the demands. Rotations and covering runs were executed with consistency, preventing the kind of broken structure Chelsea might have exploited. On the counter, Brentford threatened sporadically through Yoane Wissa’s running and set pieces, although they rarely committed large numbers forward. For Frank, the point represents another demonstration that his side can compete structurally with more expensively assembled squads. For Chelsea, it served as a reminder that breaking down organised low blocks remains an area for improvement.

      "content": "Newcastle’s 1-0 defeat to Everton at Goodison Park reopened questions about how Eddie Howe’s side cope without Bruno Guimarães at the heart of midfield. With the Brazilian suspended, Newcastle rotated options in the pivot role but could not replicate his influence on tempo and progression. Howe opted to start Lewis Miley alongside Sean Longstaff, with Joe Willock pushing higher. While the young Miley showed composure, he understandably lacked Guimarães’ range of passing and positional authority. Newcastle struggled to progress the ball through Everton’s mid-block, often resorting to longer passes towards the flanks. This played into Everton’s hands, allowing their centre-backs to dominate aerial duels. Defensively, the absence of Guimarães’ anticipation also told. Everton’s winner came from a second-ball situation on the edge of the box, an area where Guimarães often snuffs out danger. Guimarães’ dual role as both creator and destroyer makes him difficult to replace. Newcastle have alternative profiles—more energetic runners or more conservative holders—but none who combine his qualities. The problem is not simply individual. Without him, Newcastle’s entire pressing and build-up structure needs minor adjustments, and such tweaks require time on the training ground. In the longer term, recruitment may look to add a player with similar versatility, both as cover and to allow rotation. For now, Newcastle must navigate suspensions and injuries by emphasising collective responsibility. Guimarães’ absence highlighted just how central he has become to Newcastle’s project. When available, he remains one of the league’s most influential midfielders; when missing, his importance is underlined even further by the difficulty of replicating his impact.",

Under Graham Potter, Everton have tried to blend more possession-based ideas with pragmatism, and this match leaned heavily towards the latter. From the outset, Everton looked to bypass Newcastle’s press with longer passes towards Dominic Calvert-Lewin. The striker’s aerial prowess allowed Everton to contest second balls high up the pitch, bringing wingers and midfield runners into play. In midfield, Idrissa Gueye and Amadou Onana focused on winning duels and protecting the defence. They were not tasked with elaborate build-up responsibilities; instead, their priority was disrupting Newcastle’s attempts to play through the centre. Defensively, Everton’s back line remained compact, with full-backs rarely advancing simultaneously. This limited the spaces Newcastle’s wide players could exploit in transition. The winning goal arrived from a set-piece—a reflection of the emphasis Everton have placed on dead-ball situations. James Tarkowski rose highest to head home a well-delivered corner, capping a man-of-the-match performance. While the style may not have been expansive, it was suited to the occasion. In a tense game with significant implications near the bottom half of the table, Everton chose percentage football and executed it effectively. Potter will hope to gradually add more layers to the team’s play, but this victory demonstrated that Everton can still fall back on a physically robust, direct approach when necessary.

While Saints produced some of their most attractive football of the season, their high defensive line was repeatedly tested by Bournemouth’s pace in transition. Southampton dominated possession, building patiently from the back through centre-backs and a dropping pivot. Their rotations in midfield allowed them to progress into advanced areas, where overlapping full-backs and inverted wingers created overloads. The first goal came from a well-constructed move that started with goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu and involved almost every outfield player before Adam Armstrong finished from close range. However, Bournemouth’s threat on the break was constant. Long balls into the channels exploited the high line, with Dominic Solanke and Marcus Tavernier both finding joy running beyond the last defender. Southampton’s second goal, a long-range strike from Will Smallbone, was quickly followed by another Bournemouth counter that exposed the same vulnerability. Martin remains committed to his philosophy, arguing that the long-term benefits of controlled possession and aggressive positioning outweigh short-term setbacks. Yet he acknowledged the need for better rest defence—how the team positions itself to guard against transitions while attacking. For supporters, the match encapsulated the excitement and anxiety of this approach. When it works, Southampton look capable of outplaying mid-table sides; when it falters, they appear open and fragile. If they can refine their defensive structure without sacrificing attacking fluency, Southampton may yet pull away from the lower reaches of the table. For now, the high line remains both a symbol of their ambition and a challenge they must manage more effectively.",

      "content": "Wolves’ 2-1 win over Nottingham Forest at Molineux highlighted the versatility within their front line, giving manager Gary O’Neil multiple tactical options both before and during matches. With Matheus Cunha, Pedro Neto and Hwang Hee-chan all comfortable in various roles, Wolves can pose different types of problems for defences. Against Forest, O’Neil started Cunha as a nominal centre-forward, with Neto on the right and Hwang on the left. In practice, the trio constantly interchanged positions. Cunha often dropped deep to link play, allowing Hwang to attack central spaces. Neto, returning from injury, alternated between hugging the touchline and drifting inside. His dribbling forced Forest’s full-back to stay honest, opening channels for underlapping runs from midfield. The winning goal showcased this flexibility. Cunha drifted wide, drawing a centre-back with him. Neto then moved into the vacated central space to receive a cut-back and finish. Such movement requires understanding and repetition, but Wolves’ attackers appear increasingly in tune with one another. Defensively, their work rate was also impressive. The front three led the press, forcing Forest into hurried clearances and limiting their ability to build from the back. O’Neil has praised the group’s intelligence and willingness to adapt, noting that it allows him to tweak the team’s shape without needing substitutions. Whether chasing a game or protecting a lead, he can adjust pressing height and attacking patterns on the fly. If Wolves can maintain fitness levels and add further depth, particularly in central areas, their offensively flexible front line could underpin a sustained push towards the top half of the table.",

      "content": "Crystal Palace’s 0-0 draw with Luton Town at Selhurst Park extended their run of clean sheets to three matches, but the result also underlined a growing concern: a lack of attacking output. While defensive metrics paint a solid picture, Palace remain among the lowest scorers in the division. Under Oliver Glasner, Palace have tightened their shape. Marc Guéhi and Joachim Andersen form one of the league’s more reliable centre-back pairings, while the addition of a more disciplined midfield screen has reduced the number of high-quality chances conceded. However, at the other end, Palace struggle to progress the ball with sufficient speed or precision. Luton’s compact structure frustrated them for long periods, with the home side often resorting to hopeful crosses. Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise carried the creative burden, but were frequently double-marked in central areas. Without alternative routes to goal—such as overlapping full-backs or a forward capable of consistently winning aerial duels—Palace’s attacks became predictable. Statistical profiles show Palace taking fewer shots than most sides and generating low expected goals per match. Their reliance on individual moments rather than cohesive attacking patterns is evident. Glasner has acknowledged the need to adjust, hinting at potential formation tweaks or personnel changes. January recruitment could target a striker who offers penalty-box presence and the ability to combine effectively with Eze and Olise. For now, Palace’s defensive strength keeps them competitive, but unless their attacking productivity increases, they risk being dragged into the relegation picture despite respectable numbers at the back. Balancing solidity with greater risk in possession may be the next phase of Glasner’s project in south London.",

      "content": "Fulham’s 2-0 victory over Sheffield United at Craven Cottage continued a quietly impressive campaign under Marco Silva. The result was built on tactical flexibility, with Fulham shifting systems mid-game to exploit weaknesses in their opponents. Silva started with a 4-2-3-1 shape, using João Palhinha and Sasa Lukic as the double pivot behind Andreas Pereira. This provided stability in central areas and allowed full-backs to push high. When Sheffield United dropped into a deeper block, Fulham morphed into more of a 3-2-5 in possession. One full-back tucked inside to join the midfield, while the other stayed wide, creating asymmetry that proved difficult to track. The opening goal came after such a rotation. Timothy Castagne inverted from right-back, giving Palhinha the license to push forward. Pereira then drifted wide to combine with Harry Wilson, whose cut-back was converted by Raúl Jiménez. Silva’s willingness to alter structures without making substitutions has been a hallmark of Fulham’s play. The players’ understanding of different roles and zones allows the team to adapt while maintaining clarity. Defensively, Fulham were rarely troubled, with Palhinha again excelling in breaking up play. His ability to cover ground and win duels allowed others to take more attacking risks. Mid-table stability may not command headlines, but for a club of Fulham’s resources, it represents a significant achievement. If Silva’s side can maintain performance levels and continue evolving tactically, a push towards the top eight is not out of the question. For now, their adaptability remains one of their biggest strengths in a league where predictability is often punished.",

      "content": "Sheffield United’s 1-1 draw with West Ham at Bramall Lane marked a tactical shift as manager Chris Wilder reverted to a back-three system in an attempt to stop a run of defeats. While the change did not yield a win, it offered signs of greater defensive stability. United lined up in a 3-5-2, with the aim of crowding central areas and providing more cover in the channels. The extra centre-back allowed wing-backs to engage higher up the pitch without leaving the back line excessively exposed. West Ham found chances harder to come by than many of Sheffield United’s recent opponents. Crosses were dealt with more consistently, and the home side looked less vulnerable to simple balls over the top. In possession, the new shape gave United clearer outlets. Wing-backs provided width, while two central forwards offered targets for direct passes. The equalising goal, a scrappy finish after a set-piece, underlined the likelihood that United will increasingly lean on dead balls to collect points. Wilder acknowledged the limitations of the squad but emphasised that a return to a familiar structure could help rebuild confidence. The challenge will be adding enough threat in attack while maintaining the improved defensive shape. With the gap to safety growing, performances must turn into wins quickly. The back-three experiment has at least provided a platform; whether it can underpin a genuine survival push remains uncertain. What is clear is that tactical changes were necessary. United’s willingness to adapt is a step in the right direction, even if the margin for error is now extremely slim.",

      "content": "Nottingham Forest’s 1-0 win over Luton Town at the City Ground reinforced the importance of their home form in the battle against relegation. With away results difficult to come by, Forest know that turning their home ground into a fortress is crucial. From the outset, Forest played with greater intensity than in recent weeks. The home crowd responded, creating a hostile atmosphere that Luton struggled to settle into. Forest’s pressing was coordinated, particularly in wide areas where they attempted to trap Luton against the touchline. Midfielders pushed high to support forwards, forcing turnovers. The decisive goal came after a spell of sustained pressure. Morgan Gibbs-White found space between the lines and slipped a pass through to Taiwo Awoniyi, who finished confidently. Defensively, Forest were more compact than in previous outings. The back four stayed narrow, limiting the space Luton’s forwards had to operate in. Manager Nuno Espírito Santo praised his players’ “emotional control,” highlighting the importance of channelling home support positively rather than becoming anxious when chances were missed. Forest’s away record suggests that survival will likely depend on maximising points at the City Ground. Consistent intensity, organisation and use of the crowd can provide an edge in tight matches. With several relegation rivals still to visit, Forest’s ability to repeat this template may define their season. For now, the win over Luton offers both points and a blueprint for the challenges ahead.",

      "content": "Bournemouth’s 2-0 defeat of West Ham at the Vitality Stadium was a textbook demonstration of coordinated pressing triggers under Andoni Iraola. The Cherries targeted specific moments to spring forward, disrupting West Ham’s build-up and limiting their use of creative outlets. Iraola instructed his forwards to allow passes into West Ham’s full-backs before collapsing on them. Once the ball traveled wide, a nearby winger, central midfielder and full-back squeezed the zone, cutting off options back inside. This pattern repeatedly forced turnovers high up the pitch. One such regain led directly to the opening goal, with Marcus Tavernier winning possession and feeding Dominic Solanke, who finished from the edge of the box. In midfield, Bournemouth’s energy was notable. Lewis Cook and Ryan Christie covered large distances, closing passing lanes into West Ham’s attacking midfielders. As a result, West Ham were often reduced to playing long, hopeful balls that Bournemouth’s defenders handled comfortably. When leading, Bournemouth did not retreat excessively. They maintained a mid-block, ready to step up whenever triggers appeared, ensuring West Ham could not build momentum. Iraola hailed the “collective commitment” in his post-match comments, emphasising that such a system only works if all players buy in. The victory provided valuable breathing room near the bottom half of the table and reinforced the sense that Bournemouth are adapting well to Iraola’s demanding style. If they can combine this level of intensity with continued improvements in possession, Bournemouth will be confident of securing safety well before the final weeks of the campaign.",

      "content": "With Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City locked in a tight title race, much of the analysis focuses on attacking stars. However, the way each team sets and manages its defensive line is proving equally important. Arsenal operate with one of the highest lines in the division, trusting the pace and reading of the game of William Saliba and Gabriel. Their compactness between defence and midfield allows for aggressive pressing, but it requires precise timing. Liverpool also hold a high line, though their structure is slightly different. Full-backs push very high, and the responsibility for covering space falls heavily on Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté. Alisson’s sweeping ability is crucial in mopping up balls over the top. Manchester City vary their line height more, adjusting to game state and opponent. With John Stones stepping into midfield, transitions can leave temporary gaps, but City’s dominance of possession reduces the volume of times they are exposed. Statistically, all three sides concede relatively few shots overall, but the quality of chances allowed differs. Liverpool face more high-value opportunities due to the nature of their aggressive approach, while City’s control limits clear-cut opportunities against them. Arsenal sit somewhere in between, combining high pressure with improved game management. Their ability to drop five or ten yards in certain phases has helped protect leads. The team that best calibrates risk and reward in its line management may gain an advantage in the run-in. Injuries, form and fixture congestion will all influence how boldly each manager can set up. For now, the varied interpretations of high defensive lines among the top three provide a fascinating tactical subplot to an already compelling title race.",

With Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City in close proximity, the so-called mini-league between the elite clubs may determine the eventual champion. In recent seasons, City have dominated these contests, often taking points directly from their closest rivals. This has not only boosted their own tally but also limited the ability of challengers to close the gap through other results. This time, Arsenal and Liverpool have shown more resilience in big matches. Arsenal’s disciplined draw at the Etihad and Liverpool’s comeback win at Anfield earlier in the campaign demonstrated that both are better equipped tactically and mentally to compete with City. Beyond the top three, fixtures against Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester United will also carry weight. Spurs’ aggressive style, Chelsea’s emerging coherence and United’s unpredictability all make them dangerous opponents, even if they are not currently leading the race. Analysts often speak about these head-to-heads in terms of six-point swings. A single win can change momentum, shift narratives and place pressure on rivals in subsequent matches. Managers typically emphasise taking one game at a time, but it is clear that preparation for these clashes is meticulous. Tactical plans, rotation decisions and even media messaging are all carefully calibrated. The margins among the top sides look finer than in many previous seasons. As such, performance in the mini-league could prove decisive. Dropping points against mid-table teams will still hurt, but success or failure against immediate rivals may define who lifts the trophy in May. Supporters and analysts alike will circle these fixtures on the calendar, aware that the title’s destination may hinge on just a handful of 90-minute battles between English football’s heavyweights.",

      "content": "As fixture demands increase, Premier League clubs are taking different approaches to injury management, particularly those competing on multiple fronts. Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City have each adopted distinct strategies with key players. Arsenal have tended toward conservative management of niggling issues, often withdrawing players at the first sign of discomfort. Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Jesus have both been rotated more frequently than in previous seasons, with Mikel Arteta emphasising long-term availability over short-term risk. Liverpool, benefiting from improved squad depth in midfield, have been able to spread minutes across a larger group. Jürgen Klopp has spoken about the importance of “rhythm without overload,” using sports science data to determine when players require rest. Manchester City, meanwhile, continue to rely on rotation as a central pillar of Pep Guardiola’s philosophy. Few outfield players start every match, with Guardiola preferring to maintain freshness even at the cost of continuity. There are trade-offs to each approach. Heavy rotation can disrupt automatisms, while pushing key players through minor problems may increase the risk of more serious setbacks. Medical and sports science teams provide detailed information, but final decisions rest with managers and players. The competitive nature of elite athletes often leads them to declare themselves available, even when caution might be advisable. As the season progresses and recovery windows shorten, these strategies will face stern tests. The club that best balances short-term necessity with long-term health may gain a crucial edge in both domestic and European competitions. In a title race likely to be influenced by fine margins, the line between brave decisions and unnecessary risks with player fitness may prove a decisive factor.",

      "content": "An analysis of recent Premier League seasons indicates a growing influence of defensive midfielders on team performance, with players in the number six role increasingly central to both defensive and attacking phases. Metrics such as defensive actions, progressive passes and involvement in build-up sequences all point to the position being a key differentiator between sides at the top and bottom of the table. At Arsenal, Declan Rice has dramatically improved the team’s ability to control transitions. Liverpool’s transformation has been underpinned by additions in midfield capable of both pressing and progressing the ball. Manchester City’s dominance has long been associated with the presence of Rodri, whose positional sense and distribution allow City to maintain territorial control. Further down the league, teams with stable, effective holding midfielders tend to concede fewer high-quality chances and progress play more reliably. Fulham with João Palhinha and Wolves with João Gomes are examples of mid-table clubs whose number sixes significantly raise the team’s floor. Conversely, sides lacking a reliable anchor often show greater volatility in results. Defensive lines are left exposed, and build-up becomes disjointed. Clubs are responding in the transfer market, with fees for top-level defensive midfielders increasing accordingly. The role now often demands a complete skill set: physicality, tactical intelligence and technical quality. As tactical trends continue to evolve, the number six is likely to remain one of the most sought-after profiles. In a league defined by high pressing and rapid transitions, the ability to both shield and launch attacks from the base of midfield has never been more valuable.",

      "content": "International breaks are often portrayed as unwelcome interruptions, but for many Premier League clubs they provide valuable windows to reset, refine tactics and integrate returning players. The recent pause in domestic action was no exception. Managers of clubs with fewer internationals, such as Crystal Palace and Bournemouth, used the time to focus on intensive tactical work. Training sessions included scenario-specific drills and set-piece rehearsals. At the other end of the spectrum, clubs like Manchester City and Liverpool had significant portions of their first-team squads away. For them, the break allowed closer attention to be given to squad players and academy prospects. Medical and sports science departments also take advantage, implementing tailored recovery programmes for heavily used players and individual conditioning plans for those returning from injury. Some managers use the period for deeper opponent analysis, preparing detailed plans for upcoming blocks of fixtures rather than only the immediate next game. Psychologically, breaks can help reset the mood around a club. Teams in poor form have the chance to step away from relentless match cycles, while those on winning runs can guard against complacency through fresh challenges on the training ground. The effectiveness of this work is often seen in the first few matches after the break. Improved organisation on set pieces, finer pressing triggers or slightly different structures may all emerge. In a congested calendar, these pauses remain some of the few moments where managers can significantly influence team development away from the pressure of competition. As the season’s intensity increases, the groundwork laid in international breaks can have a quietly significant impact on how teams navigate the run-in.",

Expected goals for and against are almost identical, indicating that each team is creating and conceding chances at comparable rates. Both rank near the top of the league in pressing intensity and final-third entries. City maintain a slight edge in possession metrics and pass completion, reflecting their control-oriented style. Liverpool, meanwhile, perform marginally better in fast-break situations and high turnovers leading to shots. Set-piece performance is another factor. Liverpool have historically been strong in this area, and current data shows them creating more from corners and indirect free-kicks than City, who generate most of their threat from open play. Squad rotation patterns differ, but total minutes played by key players are broadly similar. The question will be whether injuries or fatigue tilt the balance as the season progresses. Head-to-head meetings could prove decisive, but the statistical picture suggests that both sides are likely to maintain high points tallies. Small factors—such as penalty conversion, goalkeeping performances in tight games or the outcome of single high-variance matches—may ultimately determine who finishes top.

      "content": "Chelsea’s 1-1 draw with Aston Villa at Villa Park showed that Mauricio Pochettino’s preferred combinations on the wings are still evolving. While the team created several promising situations, final actions and coordination in wide areas were inconsistent. Pochettino started with Raheem Sterling on the right and Mykhailo Mudryk on the left, supported by overlapping runs from Malo Gusto and Marc Cucurella. In theory, this offered dribbling threat and width on both sides. In practice, Chelsea’s best moments came when one winger moved inside to combine with Cole Palmer, allowing the full-back to attack the outside lane. However, these rotations did not happen frequently enough. Mudryk’s pace unsettled Villa’s defence, but his decision-making in the final third remained erratic. Sterling, meanwhile, drifted into central pockets but occasionally occupied the same spaces as Nicolas Jackson, compressing Chelsea’s shape. Later in the match, the introduction of Noni Madueke brought more directness on the right, and Chelsea’s attacking play briefly improved. The challenge for Pochettino is to identify pairings that balance dribbling, crossing and off-ball movement while also providing adequate pressing and defensive support. In the longer term, recruitment may further refine options, but for now, internal solutions must be found. If Chelsea can settle on more consistent partnerships in wide areas, they will likely convert more of their territorial dominance into goals, a key requirement if they are to push for European qualification next season.",

In previous seasons, such fixtures often slipped away from them in chaotic closing stages; this time, they controlled the final 20 minutes with notable composure. After taking the lead through a well-worked corner routine finished by Gabriel, Arsenal did not chase a second goal recklessly. Instead, they adjusted their block, dropping five to ten yards and focusing on denying central progression. Declan Rice and Jorginho anchored the midfield, shielding the back four and cutting off passing lanes into James Maddison. Full-backs narrowed to protect the half-spaces, inviting Spurs to play into wide areas where crosses could be defended. In possession, Arsenal were selective about when to commit numbers forward. Rather than forcing transitions at every opportunity, they used the ball to slow tempo, drawing fouls and managing the clock. Substitutions also played a role. Takehiro Tomiyasu’s introduction added height and defensive reliability, while Leandro Trossard’s fresh legs helped maintain an outlet on the counter. The overall effect was to reduce the game’s volatility. Spurs still carried threat, but were largely kept away from clear-cut chances. Mikel Arteta has spoken about the need for “grown-up performances” in big matches, and this was a clear example. It suggests Arsenal are developing the capacity not only to dominate but also to suffer intelligently when required.

Both are trying to blend expensive signings with academy graduates under managers with clear tactical ideas, yet progress has been uneven. United, under Erik ten Hag, have reached a stage where the spine of the team is largely set, but injuries and form fluctuations have hindered consistency. Chelsea, under Mauricio Pochettino, are earlier in the process of integrating a large influx of young players. On the pitch, the match was open and chaotic at times, with both sides producing moments of quality and vulnerability. United’s pressing phases showed promise but faltered when the front line tired. Chelsea’s build-up patterns were encouraging until they reached the final third, where decisions occasionally lacked clarity. Both managers have emphasised long-term projects, but expectations at each club remain high. Supporters are keen to see evidence that foundations are being laid rather than simply cycling through new plans. Data suggests that both sides underperform relative to the resources invested, yet also that underlying metrics are not as bleak as results sometimes imply. The key difference may lie in squad architecture. Chelsea’s group is younger and arguably more malleable; United’s contains more established players but also several in their peak years who may be less suited to extended transition periods. How each club handles upcoming transfer windows, contract decisions and managerial backing will shape the trajectory of their rebuilds.

      "content": "Tottenham’s 3-2 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield might have extended their inconsistent run of results, but many Spurs supporters remain optimistic due to the clarity of the team’s emerging identity under Ange Postecoglou. Even in defeat, Tottenham adhered to their principles: building from the back, maintaining a high line and attacking with numbers. They recovered from an early setback to draw level, and continued to commit players forward in search of a winner rather than retreating. James Maddison and Son Heung-min again formed the creative axis, with overlapping full-backs providing width. While their high-risk approach was punished on the counter by Liverpool’s pace, Spurs also created several chances of their own. Postecoglou has been clear that short-term setbacks will not alter the long-term plan. He believes that embedding an attacking, proactive style will, over time, yield more wins than losses—even if early stages are turbulent. Players have bought into the idea, speaking about enjoying the freedom and responsibility the system provides. The connection with the fanbase has been strengthened by visible effort and boldness, even when results fall short. Defensive adjustments will still be needed. Spurs must find ways to protect themselves better when their press is broken and full-backs are caught high. However, after years of shifting between different managerial philosophies, the sense of a coherent project is tangible. If Tottenham can add further depth, especially in central defence and holding midfield, the identity being forged under Postecoglou could serve as the platform for a more sustained challenge at the top end of the table in coming seasons. For now, performances like the one at Anfield underline that while inconsistencies remain, the direction of travel is clear—and that, for many Spurs fans, is reason to be encouraged.",

      "content": "Arsenal’s 1-0 win over Newcastle at St James’ Park was yet another demonstration of the defensive partnership that has become a cornerstone of their title push. William Saliba and Gabriel produced a commanding display, reinforcing the sense that they are now one of the most formidable centre-back pairings in the Premier League. From the first whistle, Newcastle sought to test Arsenal with direct balls into the channels and high crosses into the box. Saliba and Gabriel dealt with the aerial threat confidently, winning the majority of their duels and clearing danger before it could develop. When Alexander Isak attempted to drift into wider areas to escape their attention, one of the pair followed aggressively while the other maintained cover. What sets the duo apart is not only their physical profile but also their composure in possession. Under pressure from Newcastle’s press, both centre-backs showed a willingness to receive the ball close to their own penalty area. They stepped into midfield when appropriate, helping Arsenal create overloads and gradually take the sting out of the contest. Their line-breaking passes into Declan Rice and Martin Ødegaard allowed Arsenal to bypass the first wave of pressure and build sustained attacks. Communication between the pair has visibly improved over the last 18 months. Rotations with full-backs and the goalkeeper are more coordinated, and the defensive line moves in unison when stepping up to catch opponents offside. Newcastle were flagged several times as they tried to exploit space in behind, an indication of how well-drilled Arsenal’s back four now is. In previous seasons, Arsenal were criticised for defensive fragility in high-pressure away fixtures. Performances like this suggest that narrative is fading. Saliba and Gabriel provide a platform of reliability that allows Arsenal’s attacking players to take calculated risks, knowing there is a secure structure behind them. As the title race intensifies, the consistency of this partnership may prove as important as any goal scored at the other end of the pitch.",

      "content": "Liverpool’s 3-0 victory over Wolves at Anfield was notable not only for the starting XI but also for the range of options Jürgen Klopp was able to introduce from the bench. With a restructured midfield at the heart of this season’s resurgence, the ability to rotate without losing intensity has become one of Liverpool’s main strengths. Klopp began with a trio of Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones, a combination that offered control in possession and energy in the press. As Liverpool established a comfortable lead, the manager turned to Ryan Gravenberch and Wataru Endo, who brought fresh legs and different qualities without disrupting the overall structure. Endo’s introduction allowed Mac Allister to move slightly higher, where his passing range became even more influential between the lines. Gravenberch, meanwhile, carried the ball through midfield with power and purpose, driving Liverpool forward against a tiring Wolves side. The changes underlined how Klopp can now tailor his midfield to the rhythm of the game: technical from the start, then more physical and vertical as space opens. Beyond those on the pitch, Harvey Elliott and Stefan Bajcetic provide further options, each offering a distinct profile. Elliott’s creativity and left-footed delivery from the right half-space give Liverpool variation, while Bajcetic’s ability to play both as a holding midfielder and a more advanced eight adds tactical flexibility when fit. Liverpool’s midfield was a concern last season, with legs and control often lacking in key moments. This campaign, the combination of new signings and developing young players has transformed the area into a source of strength. As the schedule becomes increasingly demanding, Klopp’s ability to rotate between several high-level options should help Liverpool sustain a challenge on multiple fronts without overburdening any individual.",

      "content": "Manchester City’s 4-0 win over Luton Town at the Etihad once again highlighted the champions’ capacity to dismantle deep defensive blocks through carefully constructed wide overloads. While much of the attention often falls on the headline names, City’s patterns on the flanks remain a key aspect of their attacking identity. Against Luton’s low 5-4-1 structure, City repeatedly targeted the space around the visitors’ wing-backs. On the left, Josko Gvardiol, Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva formed a triangle, with one player hugging the touchline, another occupying the half-space and the third drifting inside. This gave City numerical superiority in wide areas and forced Luton’s midfield to constantly shift across. The first goal arrived after a sequence in which City recycled the ball from one flank to the other, dragging Luton out of shape. When the ball came back to the left, Grealish received on the touchline, drawing two defenders, before slipping a pass inside to Bernardo. His cut-back found Julian Alvarez free near the penalty spot to finish. On the opposite wing, Phil Foden and Kyle Walker executed similar rotations. Walker’s overlapping runs stretched the back line, while Foden frequently moved inside to operate almost as an extra attacking midfielder. This fluidity meant Luton were rarely able to double up without leaving gaps elsewhere. City’s wide overloads are not only about creating chances directly from crosses. They also function as a mechanism to destabilise the entire block. Once opponents are drawn into wide traps, central channels open for late runs from midfielders like Rodri, who almost scored from a driven shot at the edge of the area. As teams across the league become increasingly compact and organised without the ball, City’s ability to manipulate wide spaces remains a crucial differentiator. Their work on the training ground, where these patterns are rehearsed repeatedly, continues to bear fruit in the most challenging fixtures against deep-lying opponents.",

      "content": "Manchester United’s 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa at Old Trafford raised familiar questions about the team’s pressing structure under Erik ten Hag. For periods, United pressed effectively, forcing Villa into rushed clearances and recovering the ball in advanced areas. Yet these phases were interspersed with spells where the press broke down and left the back line exposed. United began aggressively, with Rasmus Højlund and Alejandro Garnacho leading from the front. Bruno Fernandes and Scott McTominay stepped high to support, attempting to pin Villa’s midfield. The approach yielded early rewards, including the opening goal, which stemmed from a turnover forced near Villa’s box. However, as the match wore on, distances between the lines increased. When United’s first wave of pressure was bypassed, Douglas Luiz and John McGinn were able to turn and drive into midfield with too much freedom. Villa’s equaliser came after such a sequence, when United’s wingers failed to recover and the midfield screen did not shift across in time. The inconsistency has been a feature of United’s season. At their best, they look capable of executing the proactive pressing game ten Hag wants, forcing mistakes from even the most accomplished opponents. At their worst, the press appears half-hearted and disjointed, leaving central defenders facing counters with insufficient protection. Part of the challenge lies in personnel. Injuries and suspensions have led to frequent changes in the front line and midfield, hindering the development of automatisms. The physical demands of the system also require high fitness levels, and fatigue has clearly played a role in certain late collapses. Ten Hag remains committed to the idea of United as a front-foot side, but turning that theoretical model into a consistent reality has proven difficult. Unless the pressing structure becomes more reliable over 90 minutes, United’s ambitions of closing the gap to the league’s elite will likely remain unfulfilled.",

      "content": "Chelsea’s 1-0 defeat to Brighton at Stamford Bridge was another frustrating afternoon in front of goal, and it is increasingly likely that attention in the January transfer window will turn to acquiring a more clinical number nine. Mauricio Pochettino’s side created chances but failed to convert, a pattern that has recurred throughout the campaign. Nicolas Jackson, once again leading the line, offered strong movement and worked tirelessly pressing from the front. He found good positions inside the box but was unable to provide the decisive finish. Mykhailo Mudryk and Cole Palmer both had opportunities from wide areas, yet hesitation at key moments allowed Brighton to recover. Chelsea’s underlying numbers suggest that chance creation is not the issue. They rank near the top of the league in expected goals, but their conversion rate from open-play opportunities lags behind other top-half sides. It is a discrepancy that has cost them points in tight matches. Recruitment staff are likely to place emphasis on a striker with a proven record in penalty-box situations: quick over short distances, decisive with one-touch finishes, and comfortable playing against both deep and high defensive lines. Age profile and adaptability to Pochettino’s pressing demands will also be factors. Balancing the development of Jackson with the need for immediate results will be a delicate task. The Senegalese forward has shown promising qualities and remains part of the club’s long-term planning. However, the pressure to secure European football may accelerate the search for additional firepower. Pochettino has publicly backed his current forwards but acknowledged that “efficiency in the box” is the area Chelsea must improve. Whether that improvement comes from internal growth or external addition will be one of the key storylines of the upcoming window and the second half of the season.",

      "content": "Tottenham’s 2-2 draw with Everton at Goodison Park extended their unbeaten run but further highlighted the strain on Ange Postecoglou’s defensive resources. With multiple first-choice defenders unavailable, Spurs were forced into another reshuffled back line, prompting a subtle tactical rethink. Postecoglou has built Tottenham’s identity on an aggressive high line and front-foot defending. However, with Cristian Romero suspended and Micky van de Ven injured, the manager turned to a combination of Eric Dier and Emerson Royal in central defence. Lacking the same recovery pace, Spurs could not push up as fearlessly as usual. The adjustment saw Tottenham occasionally drop into a slightly deeper mid-block when Everton built from the back, with one full-back staying narrower to provide additional cover. While the principles of proactive play remained, there was a clear recognition that the usual level of defensive risk was less sustainable given the personnel. Despite this, Spurs still committed numbers forward in attack. Pedro Porro and Destiny Udogie continued to push high, and their overlapping runs were key to both goals scored. Yet Everton’s equaliser stemmed from a transition in which the makeshift central pairing was left isolated, illustrating the ongoing balancing act. Postecoglou has insisted that the team will not abandon its core principles, but he has also acknowledged the need for “smart aggression” when key defenders are missing. January reinforcements at centre-back are likely to be a priority to reduce the drop-off when first-choice options are unavailable. For now, Spurs’ ability to adapt while maintaining attacking threat will be tested in every fixture. The points gained during this period may prove valuable if, later in the campaign, a fully fit defence allows them to return to their most expansive version in the race for Champions League qualification.",

Roberto De Zerbi’s side once again showcased intricate build-up play, positional rotations and a willingness to commit numbers forward. With key forwards having left in recent windows, Brighton have relied on a committee approach to scoring. João Pedro, Simon Adingra and Kaoru Mitoma all contributed heavily against West Ham, rotating positions fluidly across the front line. At various points, each player took turns operating centrally, attacking from the flanks or dropping between the lines. Brighton’s midfield supported the attack with characteristic bravery in possession. Pascal Gross and Billy Gilmour repeatedly received under pressure, drawing West Ham’s press before releasing the ball into vacated spaces. The second goal came after Gross lured two opponents towards him before threading a disguised pass into Mitoma’s path. De Zerbi’s system places substantial demands on players’ technical and tactical intelligence. New signings are expected to adapt quickly, understanding when to occupy certain zones and how to respond to triggers in and out of possession. Recruitment has again focused on profiles comfortable in such a complex structure. Defensively, Brighton remain vulnerable at times, particularly in transition, but their ability to outscore opponents has kept them in the hunt for European places. The club’s sustained capacity to play attractive, proactive football while integrating new faces speaks to the strength of their long-term planning. As interest in Brighton’s standout performers continues from across Europe, the cycle of departures and arrivals is likely to persist. Yet if evidence from this season is any guide, the underlying framework is robust enough to absorb change and keep the team competitive towards the upper reaches of the table.",

      "content": "Newcastle’s 2-1 win over Brentford at St James’ Park owed much to their continued proficiency from set pieces, a vital source of goals in a season where open-play fluency has been disrupted by injuries and rotation. Eddie Howe’s side may not be hitting last year’s heights, but dead-ball situations remain a reliable route to points. The opening goal came from a well-rehearsed corner routine. Kieran Trippier delivered an outswinging ball towards the penalty spot, where Sven Botman peeled away from his marker to head powerfully into the net. The movement of decoy runners created enough separation for Botman to attack the cross unchallenged. Newcastle’s set-piece work goes beyond simple deliveries into the box. They use blocks, late runs and varied trajectories to unsettle opponents. Free-kicks often involve short combinations before a cross, drawing defenders out and changing the angle of attack. Defensively, they are equally organised. Nick Pope commands his area effectively, and the aerial strength of Botman, Fabian Schär and Dan Burn gives Newcastle a solid platform when defending corners and long throws. Opponents rarely enjoy clear headers inside the six-yard box. With open-play metrics down on last season, the continued output from set pieces has taken on increased importance. It allows Newcastle to remain competitive in tight matches even when they are not at their fluid best with the ball. As the campaign progresses, refining these routines further—and ensuring key deliverers like Trippier stay fit—could be crucial. In a league where margins are thin, Newcastle’s attention to detail on set pieces remains one of their defining strengths and a key factor in their bid to stay in the European conversation.",

      "content": "Aston Villa’s 1-1 draw with Fulham at Craven Cottage marked the start of a challenging run of fixtures that will test Unai Emery’s rotation strategy for the first time this season. With European commitments adding to domestic responsibilities, the Villa manager must balance freshness with continuity to sustain their push for the top four. Against Fulham, Emery made several changes from the side that had impressed the previous weekend. Key figures such as Ollie Watkins and Douglas Luiz started, but others were rested or introduced from the bench. The result was a slightly disjointed performance, with Villa struggling to find their usual rhythm in the first half before improving after the break. Emery has spoken about the importance of building “two players for every position” to cope with the demands of modern schedules. The emergence of options like Jhon Durán in attack and Leon Bailey in wide areas has helped, while the versatility of John McGinn and Youri Tielemans provides flexibility in midfield. Defensively, the rotation of centre-backs Pau Torres, Ezri Konsa and Diego Carlos must be managed carefully to maintain cohesion. The high defensive line Villa employ relies heavily on communication and timing; frequent changes can disrupt those relationships. The coming weeks include fixtures against direct rivals for European places and decisive European ties. Emery’s decisions on when to rest core players such as Watkins and Luiz may shape the outcome of both campaigns. Villa’s progress under Emery has been built on clear principles and intense work on the training ground. Maintaining those standards while rotating personnel is the next step in their evolution from an improving side to a consistently elite one. How well they navigate this period will reveal a great deal about their capacity to compete at the highest level over the long term.",

David Moyes’ side has produced memorable nights on the continent, but managing the physical and mental demands of playing on multiple fronts appears increasingly challenging. Against Liverpool, West Ham competed well for long spells but faded in the final half-hour. Players who have logged heavy minutes in Europe, such as Jarrod Bowen, Mohammed Kudus and Lucas Paquetá, showed signs of fatigue as the game progressed. Second balls that were contested aggressively early on began to be lost more frequently. Moyes has rotated where possible, using the depth of his squad to rest key individuals in certain fixtures. However, the drop-off in quality and familiarity has at times been evident. The team’s compact defensive structure relies heavily on coordinated movement; when new combinations are introduced, small timing errors can have big consequences. Balancing ambition with realism is the dilemma. West Ham’s supporters have revelled in European success, and the club understandably sees continental competition as a sign of progress. Yet the Premier League’s intensity means any slight dip in physical levels or concentration is quickly punished. The January window may offer an opportunity to bolster the squad, particularly in central midfield and full-back areas where depth is most tested. In the shorter term, Moyes will need to decide in which fixtures to prioritise his strongest line-ups. West Ham’s capacity to sustain performance across both competitions will likely determine whether this season is remembered primarily for European adventures or for solidifying their status as a regular presence in the top half of the Premier League.

      "content": "Brentford’s 2-1 win over Crystal Palace shone a spotlight on the importance of their midfield engine room, where Christian Nørgaard and Vitaly Janelt continue to provide the balance that underpins Thomas Frank’s tactical approach. While much attention is given to Brentford’s set-piece prowess and forward line, the work done in central areas is just as vital to their stability. Nørgaard, operating as the deepest midfielder, orchestrated Brentford’s defensive block. He consistently positioned himself to cut off passing lanes into Palace’s playmakers, forcing them into wide areas where Brentford were comfortable defending crosses. His anticipation allowed him to make several key interceptions, stopping transitions before they developed. Alongside him, Janelt offered tireless running and ball-carrying ability. When Brentford regained possession, he was often the first to break forward, driving the team up the pitch and supporting attacks. His willingness to make third-man runs into the box added an extra dimension to Brentford’s forward play. In possession, the pair showed composure and simplicity. They circulated the ball intelligently, switching play when Palace’s press became lopsided and ensuring Brentford’s full-backs and wide forwards received in favourable positions. This control helped Brentford avoid long spells under pressure. Frank’s system is demanding on central midfielders, requiring them to contribute in all phases: pressing, screening, progressing and arriving in the final third. Nørgaard and Janelt have developed an understanding that allows them to share these responsibilities effectively. Brentford’s ability to remain competitive in the league despite occasional absences in other positions owes much to the consistency of this partnership. As long as they continue to set the tone in midfield, Brentford will feel confident of securing another comfortable mid-table finish, with the potential to push once again towards the top half.",

Long regarded as a side that could score but also concede in flurries, Fulham are gradually tightening their structure without losing their attacking identity. At Molineux, Fulham maintained a compact 4-4-2 shape without the ball, with wingers tracking back diligently to protect full-backs. João Palhinha anchored midfield with his usual authority, breaking up play and winning second balls, while Tosin Adarabioyo and Calvin Bassey marshalled the penalty area effectively. Wolves were limited to a handful of clear chances, most of which were from low-probability angles or outside the box. Fulham’s ability to prevent passes into dangerous central pockets forced their opponents into predictable crossing situations. The improvement is also evident in the numbers. Fulham’s expected goals against have trended downward over recent weeks, suggesting that the quality of chances they allow is decreasing. That shift reflects better coordination in pressing, more disciplined rest defence and a commitment from attacking players to contribute off the ball. Silva has been clear that Fulham’s ambitions extend beyond mere survival. To challenge for the top half on a regular basis, they must match their offensive output with defensive solidity. The current trajectory suggests that balance is being gradually achieved. If this defensive foundation can be maintained, Fulham’s creative players will have greater freedom to express themselves, knowing that the structure behind them is less likely to unravel.

With several key contributors in their early twenties, Wolves appear to be building a team that can grow together over the coming seasons. Matheus Cunha and Pedro Neto remain at the centre of that vision. Against Southampton, Cunha’s intelligent movement between the lines and Neto’s direct running down the right flank were constant outlets whenever Wolves regained possession. Both players have room to refine their decision-making but already carry significant influence. Behind them, João Gomes once again demonstrated his importance in midfield. His ball-winning ability, stamina and willingness to drive forward with the ball have made him a key figure in O’Neil’s plans. At just 22, he has the potential to become one of the Premier League’s standout box-to-box midfielders. In defence, Toti Gomes and Rayan Aït-Nouri are also developing rapidly. Toti’s versatility in playing both centrally and wider in a back three gives Wolves flexibility, while Aït-Nouri’s attacking instincts from left-back add another dimension to their build-up. Short-term challenges remain, particularly around squad depth and consistency. Wolves have dropped points from winning positions and still lack the experience in certain game states that more seasoned squads possess. However, the underlying direction is positive. If the club can retain its core and supplement it with targeted additions, Wolves’ youthful side could be well-positioned to evolve into a regular top-half challenger.

      "content": "Crystal Palace’s 2-1 defeat to Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium highlighted an ongoing tactical dilemma for Oliver Glasner: the role of his full-backs in a system that seeks both defensive solidity and greater attacking ambition. Against Bournemouth, Palace’s full-backs were often caught between staying deep to guard against counters and pushing forward to provide width. Glasner has encouraged Palace to build more patiently from the back, with centre-backs splitting and a midfielder dropping in to assist. Full-backs are asked to step higher to stretch opposition blocks, but this increases the risk of being exposed when possession is lost. At Bournemouth, Tyrick Mitchell and Nathaniel Clyne were reluctant to commit fully in the first half, mindful of the home side’s pace in transition. This caution left Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise isolated when they received between the lines, as overlapping support was limited. When Palace did push the full-backs higher in the second half, they looked more dangerous in attack, delivering several promising crosses. However, Bournemouth’s second goal arrived from a quick break into the space vacated on the flank, illustrating the trade-off. The balance is delicate. Palace’s central defenders are strong in the air but less comfortable when dragged into wide channels. Glasner must decide whether to prioritise compactness at the expense of offensive support, or accept greater risk in pursuit of more goals. Training-ground work will focus on improving rest defence—how the team positions itself to guard against counters while attacking. Better staggering of midfielders and smarter counter-pressing can help mitigate the risk of full-backs advancing. Until that balance is found, Palace are likely to continue experiencing swings in performance, looking solid in some phases and open in others. Solving the full-back conundrum is a key step in turning Glasner’s tactical ideas into consistent results.",

Graham Potter’s selection of Idrissa Gueye, Amadou Onana and Abdoulaye Doucouré gave Everton control of central areas in and out of possession. Gueye anchored the base, screening the defence and breaking up play with his usual tenacity. His ability to read passing lanes limited Forest’s ability to find Morgan Gibbs-White in dangerous pockets between the lines. Onana, operating slightly ahead, used his athleticism to cover large spaces. He was instrumental in both pressing Forest’s midfielders and providing an outlet during transitions. Several of Everton’s most promising attacks began with Onana carrying the ball forward through the centre of the pitch. Doucouré, meanwhile, offered vertical runs into the box, adding a goal threat that forced Forest’s defenders to track him closely. His movement created room for wide players and contributed to the decisive goal, as he arrived late to win a second ball before setting up Dominic Calvert-Lewin. The trio’s physical presence and work rate provided Everton with a platform rarely seen earlier in the season. When they are all fit and available, Everton look significantly more robust in midfield battles and better equipped to protect leads. Potter will hope to keep this group together as much as possible while also developing more composure in possession.

      "title": "Bournemouth’s Solanke Continues to Elevate His All-Round Centre-Forward Game",
      "content": "Bournemouth’s 2-1 comeback win against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane owed much to another impressive performance from Dominic Solanke, whose evolution into a complete Premier League centre-forward continues apace. Once questioned for his finishing at the top level, Solanke is now providing both goals and a wide range of contributions outside the box. Against Sheffield United, Solanke scored the equaliser with a sharp turn and finish inside the area, showcasing improved composure in tight spaces. But it was his overall link play that stood out. Dropping off the front line, he helped connect Bournemouth’s midfield and wingers, playing several incisive passes into runners. Solanke’s hold-up play has become increasingly reliable. He shielded the ball effectively under pressure, winning fouls to relieve defensive strain and allowing Bournemouth to move up the pitch. His aerial presence also provided an outlet against United’s high pressing. Defensively, Solanke led the team’s press with intelligence, closing centre-backs on specific triggers and angling his runs to force play into areas Bournemouth had targeted. His work rate set the tone for the rest of the side. Statistically, his goals and expected goals tallies have improved, reflecting better shot selection and confidence in front of goal. He remains central to Andoni Iraola’s system, which requires the striker to contribute in all phases. If Solanke maintains his current trajectory, he will not only be key to Bournemouth’s survival prospects but could also attract attention from clubs higher up the table. For now, his focus is firmly on continuing to deliver decisive performances that keep Bournemouth clear of the relegation fight.",

      "title": "Nottingham Forest’s Defensive Shape Under Review After Late Collapses",
      "content": "Nottingham Forest’s 3-2 defeat to Spurs at the City Ground added another painful chapter to a season marked by late collapses. Having twice led in the contest, Forest conceded two goals in the final 20 minutes, prompting renewed scrutiny of their defensive shape in closing stages. For much of the match, Forest’s 4-3-3 structure looked organised. They compressed space effectively in midfield and restricted Spurs to speculative efforts from distance. However, as fatigue set in, gaps appeared between the back line and midfield, allowing Tottenham’s substitutes to find dangerous pockets. The equalising goal arrived after Forest failed to clear a cross properly, with their defensive line slow to push out and track second-phase runners. The winner came from a transition in which full-backs were caught high and central defenders were left exposed against fresh legs. Manager Nuno Espírito Santo identified “concentration and compactness” as key issues. Forest’s willingness to push for a decisive third goal left them vulnerable, and they lacked the experience to manage the game when under pressure. Improving rest defence—maintaining a stable structure even when attacking—will be vital. That may involve keeping one full-back deeper, asking a midfielder to hold position more conservatively, or making earlier substitutions to preserve energy. If Forest cannot address these recurring patterns, they risk undoing good work in other phases of play. With points at a premium in the relegation battle, turning winning positions into draws or defeats is a habit they can ill afford to maintain.",

      "title": "Sheffield United’s Lack of Cutting Edge Leaves Defensive Efforts Unrewarded",
      "content": "Sheffield United’s 1-0 defeat to Fulham at Craven Cottage encapsulated their season-long problem: respectable defensive organisation undermined by a lack of cutting edge in the final third. Chris Wilder’s adjustments have tightened the back line, but goals remain desperately hard to come by. United defended in a compact 5-3-2, limiting Fulham’s ability to play through central areas. Centre-backs dealt well with crosses, and the midfield trio worked hard to close down space on the edge of the box. For long stretches, Fulham were forced into shots from distance. However, when opportunities arose on the break, United failed to capitalise. Attacks were often under-supported, with the front two isolated and wing-backs unable to join quickly enough. Final passes lacked precision, and when half-chances did appear, composure in front of goal was missing. The decisive Fulham goal came from a momentary lapse at a set piece rather than sustained pressure, adding to the frustration. Wilder acknowledged that “one mistake” had cost his side, but the underlying issue remained the absence of a reliable route to goals. Recruitment in attacking areas will be a priority if United are to stand any chance of mounting a survival push. A forward capable of holding up play and converting low-probability chances could transform fine margins. For now, the effort and structure in defence ensure United remain competitive in individual matches, but without greater threat going forward, those efforts too often go unrewarded in terms of points. The gap to safety will only widen unless that changes quickly.",

      "title": "Southampton’s Young Wingers Offer Hope in Fight Against the Drop",
      "content": "Southampton’s 2-1 win over Everton at St Mary’s provided a reminder that, despite their position near the bottom of the table, the squad contains young attacking talent capable of changing games. Wingers Samuel Edozie and Kamaldeen Sulemana were instrumental in turning the contest in Saints’ favour. Edozie, starting on the left, repeatedly drove at Everton’s back line, committing defenders and drawing fouls in dangerous areas. His willingness to receive the ball under pressure and take on opponents one-versus-one gave Southampton a directness that has sometimes been lacking. On the opposite flank, Sulemana was equally lively. His pace stretched Everton’s defence, particularly in transition, where his runs into space behind full-backs created opportunities. The equaliser came after Sulemana beat his marker on the outside and delivered a low cross that Adam Armstrong converted at the near post. Russell Martin’s possession-based approach relies on forwards who can exploit the spaces created by intricate build-up. If Edozie and Sulemana can combine their individual flair with greater consistency in end product, they may provide Southampton with the goals and assists needed to climb the table. Defensively, both wingers contributed by tracking back, helping full-backs deal with Everton’s wide threats. This work rate will be essential if Martin is to trust them in high-stakes fixtures. The challenge for Southampton is to harness their potential without placing excessive burden on their shoulders. Managed carefully, the development of these young wingers could be central not only to this season’s survival bid but also to the club’s longer-term prospects in the Premier League.",

      "title": "Stat Snapshot: Comparing Big-Six Attacking Trios in the Premier League",
      "content": "A statistical snapshot of the Premier League’s big-six attacking trios reveals intriguing contrasts in style and output, highlighting how different approaches can be effective at the top level. Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham all rely heavily on their front three, but the data shows varied profiles. Liverpool’s trio of Mohamed Salah, Darwin Núñez and Luis Díaz leads the way in combined expected goals and shots per 90 minutes. Their direct, vertical style produces a high volume of attempts, particularly on the break, with Núñez frequently topping the league for shots per game. Arsenal’s combination of Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli generates slightly fewer shots but higher-quality chances, reflected in strong non-penalty expected goals figures. Their rotations and interplay in tight spaces lead to more cut-backs and central finishes. Manchester City’s front line is more fluid, with Erling Haaland typically flanked by two of Phil Foden, Jack Grealish or Bernardo Silva. While City’s wide forwards shoot less often than their counterparts elsewhere, their involvement in chance creation is high, contributing multiple key passes per match. Tottenham’s group, spearheaded by Son Heung-min alongside Dejan Kulusevski and a rotating third option, ranks highly in shots from fast breaks. Their transitional threat is among the most potent in the division, though overall chance volume is slightly lower due to extended periods defending. Chelsea and Manchester United, by contrast, have seen more fluctuation. Chelsea’s evolving trio, often featuring Raheem Sterling, Nicolas Jackson and Cole Palmer, posts encouraging underlying numbers but lower conversion rates, mirroring the team’s broader finishing issues. United’s combination of Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Højlund and Antony has been disrupted by form and availability, resulting in lower collective output. The data underlines that there is no single template for a successful attacking trio. Some are built on volume, others on efficiency; some on transitions, others on positional play. What unites the most effective groups, however, is cohesion: clear roles, complementary skill sets and an understanding of when to rotate or hold position. As the season progresses, adjustments in personnel and tactical emphasis will continue to reshape the statistical landscape, but for now, these numbers offer a useful lens on how the league’s biggest clubs are constructing their forward lines.",
