So training is not there but obviously the fact that you are missing players, you are loading other players more [as] a consequence. It's a really dangerous circle that one.\"\nArsenal also had to deal with long-term injuries to Havertz and Bukayo Saka last season, while centre-back Gabriel missed an important couple of months at the end of the last campaign.\nAnd Arteta said that alongside the Arsenal medical team he was always looking at the reasons for the injuries they suffer.\n\"Some of the players have played over 150 games in two seasons so it starts to get overloaded. You start to ask them again and again and again to do that [and] at some point they will break down,\" he said.\n\"It's something that we are constantly looking at. We have played a lot of games with a lot of players missing that puts a lot of stress and then more injuries but we are on it.\n\"I'm really happy what we're doing in terms of the medical stuff and everything that we are trying to bring together, but sometimes as well we need some things to go on our side.\"\nThe football calendar has been been a much-debated topic in recent months.\nArsenal and Crystal Palace have had matches moved by the Premier League later this month to ease fixture congestion.\nArsenal's trip to Everton and Palace's game at Leeds - both originally scheduled for 14:00 GMT on Sunday, 21 December - will now be played at 20:00 a day earlier.\nThe games were shifted as the two sides play each other in the EFL Cup quarter-final on 23 December.\nArsenal have already played 22 games across all competitions as they compete in the Premier League, the Champions League and the Carabao Cup. They start their FA Cup campaign in January against Portsmouth.\nLast year the top European leagues, including the Premier League, and global players' union Fifpro filed a legal complaint against world governing body Fifa over what they called  its \"abuse of dominance\" in the game.\nThe European Leagues, which represents 39 leagues and 1,130 clubs in 33 countries, said at the time that it was filing the complaint to the European Commission to protect the welfare of players.\nLast month Fifa announced a series of measures it said would address player welfare, including having at least 72 hours of rest between matches, and a rest period of at least 21 days at the end of each season.\nHowever Fifpro  - which was not involved in talks prior to the announcement - accused Fifa of undermining plans to tackle player welfare issues by consulting with \"Fifa-friendly organisations for consultation processes rather than engaging with the recognised football representative bodies\".\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?", "source": "BBC", "league": "Premier League", "published_date": "2025-12-09T21:15:01"}

They have now led in games for longer this season than they did in the entirety of the 2024-25 campaign.\nYet Amorim felt compelled to add a caveat, making reference to Wolves' lack of points on the pitch and mutinous atmosphere off it.\n\"This is a specific case,\" he said. \"We faced a team that is really, really struggling.\n\"You can sense it in every situation of the game.\n\"This moment for Wolves is really hard, as a team and as a club. We took advantage of that.\"\nIt is why Amorim felt United were in danger of blowing a significant chance to climb into the top six and on the coattails of the sides in contention for Champions League qualification.\nNew Wolves boss Rob Edwards felt his side played the way he wanted in the final 15 minutes of the opening period. That included scoring their first goal in 540 minutes through Jean-Ricner Bellegarde.\nIt wasn't the script Amorim envisaged. Certainly not one he wanted on a night when Sir Jim Ratcliffe had come to watch and was pictured in animated conversation with director of football Jason Wilcox in the directors' box.\nHe told his players this before he left to sit in the visitors' dugout alone with his thoughts before United re-appeared for the start of the second half.\n\"We should have finished that half in a different way,\" he said. \"At half-time, they understood we have everything to win the game.\n\"If you need to be really distracted, when you look at Everton, that was three points. We could have had two more points against West Ham. Look at the table. Look at the environment. Look at everything.\n\"We needed to win the second half. It didn't matter the result.\"\nAnalysing the game for Sky Sports, Jamie Carragher praised the performance but said: \"We make the assumption there is a bad result around the corner.\"\nHe is not on his own with that opinion. United have still kept only one clean sheet in the Premier League, against Sunderland at Old Trafford on 4 October. Are they on one defeat in nine, or two wins in six?\nAfter failing to take opportunities to go second - twice - they are now sixth. If results go their way, they could be fourth once they have played Bournemouth on 15 December. Equally they could slide back into a mid-table position.\nAndoni Iraola's men have taken two points from their past six games but they have won 3-0 on each of their past two visits to Old Trafford.\nNothing is for certain at Manchester United these days, it seems, and that includes the availability of their players.\nAmorim had thought the Netherlands international Matthijs de Ligt would be available for Monday's game after missing the West Ham match with a minor injury. He was wrong. Now the manager says he can't be sure when De Ligt will be fit.\nUnited remain in talks with the respective national associations of Morocco, Ivory Coast and Cameroon, which Amorim said is a \"good sign\" but added he \"doesn't know\" if Noussair Mazraoui, Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo will be cleared to play against Bournemouth before they leave for Africa Cup of Nations duty.\n\"Let's wait for the middle of the week,\" said Amorim.\nAsked what moving into sixth place means, he added: \"Nothing. It's always the same feeling. We should have more points. But that's in the past, let's focus on the future.\"\nManchester United have now been in front for longer this season than they were in the whole of last season\nMason Mount's goal means he has now scored three times in the past four games he has started.\nThe England star is now beginning to make the sustained impacted envisaged when he moved from Chelsea for Â£55m in 2023, before injuries halted his progress.\nIt also means Amorim has options given main striker Benjamin Sesko is currently injured and Mbeumo will be leaving at some point in the near future.\n\"If you compare the past he had in Chelsea, he has a great quality,\" said Amorim.\n\"He can defend. He can attack and the quality when he touches the ball is really good.\n\"It's not a surprise for me. But, of course, we need to take care of him.\n\"But he's going to build that and is going to be really important for our club.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?", "source": "BBC", "league": "Premier League", "published_date": "2025-12-09T00:04:50"}

I don't think it was.\n\"When Mo Salah stops in the mixed zone - which he has done four times in eight years - it is choreographed with him and his agent to cause maximum damage and strengthen his own position.\"\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sutton said: \"Liverpool is carnage because of Mo Salah.\n\"He's been honest and open, but he's made it all about him and not the team. He's been extremely selfish - that's what he's done because now there's a bit of a civil war at Liverpool, and it didn't need to be like this.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot said he was\"surprised\" by Salah's commentsthat their relationship had broken down completely and had \"no clue\" if the 33-year-old would play for the club again.\n\"I don't feel my authority is undermined - it is not the way I feel it,\" said Slot in Milan on Monday.\n\"After tomorrow we will look at the situation.

He has tried to throw the club under the bus twice in the last 12 months.\n\"Going after the owners initially, he complained a year ago because they hadn't given him a contract at the age of 32.\n\"With the manager, he should be doing all he can to help the club get out of the worst run of results they have had since the 1950s.\"\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, former England captain Steph Houghton agreed.\n\"It probably couldn't have come at a worse time for Liverpool,\" she said.\n\"That's what makes us think this is something that was pre-planned. He probably expected to come on at some point [against Leeds], he didn't, and for Mo Salah that probably hurts his ego.\n\"But it's poor from him. I think it does put other people in jeopardy. It's got us talking about it, which he wants.\"\nCarragher also called for Salah not to be \"obsessed\" with his own numbers and suggested he should help the other players, such as big-money signings Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, who are hoping to emulate his success at the club.\n\"Some of the criticism has been excessive this season, but I will go after Mo Salah when he tries to throw my club under the bus off the pitch and just thinks about himself,\" Carragher added.\n\"The club have made the right decision in him not going abroad with them and whether he will play for the club again I don't know.\n\"I hope he does because he is one of the greatest players we have ever had.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'He's put his team-mates in jeopardy' - Coady\nAfter a stellar season in 2024-25, in which he spearheaded Liverpool's surge to the title, Salah has been short of his best this campaign with only five goals in 19 games.\n\"He's had a phenomenal career,\" Sutton said.\n\"This season he hasn't played so well, his numbers are down, he's not the same player and all of a sudden he's been left out for a few games and wants to live by different rules than other players in the dressing room.\n\"I find the whole situation absolutely ridiculous.\n\"What good could come out of what he did? What sickens me a bit about it is when Liverpool have been doing well, and players come out and speak, 'it's the team spirit, we all get on so great and everything's marvellous'.\n\"And now we're seeing Mo Salah for what he really is. It's all about him. It's him being selfish. I hate that sort of stuff. I think he's really let himself down here.\n\"It's all about who will go - will it be Slot or will it be Salah?

Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\nBart Verbruggen (Brighton):He made four or five really good saves and kept them in the game in thedraw against West Ham. On another day West Ham go on to win that. He was bang on it and a big reason why Brighton nicked a draw.\nMatty Cash (Aston Villa):Wonderful goal as Aston Villabeat Arsenaland great defending. As a Birmingham fan it pains me to give him credit but he was great and Aston Villa were fantastic. Everyone feels Arsenal are going to run away with the league, but Aston Villa said \"no, not on my watch\".\nMarc Guehi (Crystal Palace):He got his team over the line for theirwin at Fulhamand led by example as he always does. He got my mind thinking - not only did he play well this weekend and has been great all season, how much would Liverpool not be in this mess if they had managed to sign him? How good could Liverpool be if they had a proper centre-half like him?\nMarco Senesi (Bournemouth):I don't know where Bournemouth keep getting these players from. They sold two centre-halves in the summer and he has just stepped in no problem. He's been absolutely fantastic, and was again as theyshut out Chelsea.\nBruno Guimaraes (Newcastle):I'm putting Bruno at the base of a diamond in midfield because he is the heart, soul and spirit of Newcastle's team, and was brilliant againagainst Burnley. He is just a very good football player and there are not many people you can say that about.\nAnton Stach (Leeds):He was the player who stood out for Leeds in theirdraw with Liverpool. The visitors were obviously cruising but I look at players and teams in that moment and look at who is hiding. This guy turned it up - not only a notch but another 10 notches - scored a goal and got an assist.\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Everton):Is he the signing of the season? He has been fantastic. Not only is he scoring, he is pulling the strings and has become the heartbeat of this new-look Everton team under David Moyes, who can get another gear out of these players as they didagainst Nottingham Forest.\nBruno Fernandes (Manchester United):Top of the diamond is Fernandes. Two goalsat Wolvesand an assist. His passing was fantastic. He loses a bit of credit because it was against arguably the worst team I have ever seen in Wolves, but he did very well. Manchester United are back on the winning trail.\nXavi Simons (Tottenham):He has had a bit of a tough time at Spurs but it felt like this was his moment to show everyone why people think he is so talented. He has pace, power and glides past people. We used to call people like that a luxury but when you put in a match-winning performance like he didagainst Brentford, you have to start saying he is just good.\nHugo Ekitike (Liverpool):Even though he is in a team that is a shambles, he gets in through the middle. He scored two goals against Leeds. I understand Liverpool spent a lot of money on Alexander Isak - and I am a huge fan - but just start this kid. Get the two of them up front and figure it out.\nRayan Cherki (Manchester City)My favourite footballer to watch in world football. Not only was his assist for Phil Foden in thewin against Sunderlandworth the admission fee, he was just delightful. He is like the cult heroes I grew up with and makes me feel like a kid again watching football. Back in the day you had Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Jay-Jay Okocha - a plethora of them. Now there is just Rayan Cherki - and he is fantastic.\nUnai Emery (Aston Villa):A massive game for Aston Villa. Against Arsenal it was that match where he gets to say: \"Remember me? You got rid of me.\" I think with all that being said, Emery is manager of the week.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your team of the week? Have your say using the comments form below:\nHugo Ekitike\nWith Liverpool and Mohamed Salah appearing to bemoving in different directions- and Salah heading to join his Egypt team-mates for the Africa Cup of Nations next week anyway - the Reds need other players to step up and fill the Salah-shaped hole in the scoring charts. In Hugo Ekitike, they may have found that man.\nEkitike is now Liverpool's leading Premier League scorer with five goals, while in all competitions he also tops the charts with eight. On Saturday at Elland Road, the Frenchman scored the first double of his Liverpool career, and with the goals coming in the 48th and 50th minutes, he was the first Premier League player to score twice in the opening five minutes of the second half since Raheem Sterling in March 2019 for Manchester City against Watford.\nHe led all players in the match for shots (5), shots on target (3) and touches in the opposition box (9) and his only disappointment must have been the scoreline - he was the first Liverpool player to score two goals in a Premier League and not win since Salah last December in a 3-3 draw with Newcastle.\nRayan Cherki\nDespite playing just 398 minutes in the Premier League this season, no player has more assists than Manchester City's Rayan Cherki (5), with two of those coming in the 3-0 victory over Sunderland.\nCherki created six chances in open play, the joint most by a player in a Premier League game this season, while at 22 years and 111 days on Saturday he was the second-youngest Manchester City player to achieve that in a Premier League game, older only than - maybe surprisingly - Mario Balotelli in February 2012 against Blackburn Rovers.\nAmong players to play 300 minutes in the Premier League, no player has created more chances per 90 minutes than Cherki (3.4) and only four have had more touches in the opposition box per 90 minutes (7.7). The Frenchman is currently assisting a goal, on average, every 80 minutes - also a league best.\nBruno Guimaraes\nBruno Guimaraes has taken 10 corners in the Premier League this season and it is clear which one of those was most memorable - his in-swinging delivery on Saturday against Burnley caught his former team-mate Martin Dubravka out to give the Magpies the lead.\nIt was not the first Premier League goal direct from a corner(or 'Olympico goal' as it's known)but it was Newcastle's first ever corner to be put directly into the opponent's goal in the Premier League, to give Guimaraes a slice of Magpies history. Given the term Olympico goal originates from South America, it seems apt that four of the past seven direct corner goals have been scored by players from that continent - all, in fact, from Brazil. Those scorers are Matheus Pereira, Douglas Luiz, Matheus Cunha and Guimaraes.\nAside from swinging corners directly into the net, Guimaraes has been in excellent recent form - he now has four goals and two assists across his past nine Premier League appearances, scoring five in total this season. Only in 2023-24 has he ever scored more in one season, netting seven times.\nFollow your Premier League club on BBC Sport\nAll your football quizzes in one place\nGet football news sent straight to your phone", "source": "BBC", "league": "Premier League", "published_date": "2025-12-08T23:43:38"}

What we want is for him and the club to reach an agreement in the best interests of him and the club and all of the playing staff.\n\"I hope he plays again for the club.\"\nHe added: \"We as his team-mates and his friends, we hope the best thing happens for him, but as Liverpool FC players we want the best for the club as well. We want a win-win situation for everyone.\"\nAlisson also backed his manager Slot, adding: \"We believe [in] his style of play and that he is capable of helping us to turn around this situation.\"\nThis video can not be played\nArne Slot reacts to Salah comments\nAlmost 48 hours after Salah spoke, this was Arne Slot's chance to say his piece.\nMonday was a public holiday in Milan but the media conference room inside the San Siro was still packed. It is hard to think of a more anticipated pre-match media conference in recent times.\nSlot used his humour to start off by joking with a reporter that he asked five questions in one, but minute by minute, details began to emerge and it was clear to see who was in charge.\nWhen BBC Sport asked him whether he understood Salah's comments when the Egyptian said he was \"thrown under the bus\", Slot said: \"Usually I'm calm, I'm polite but I'm not weak. If a player has these comments about so many things, then it's up to me and the club to react. We reacted in a way you can see because he's not here.\"\nThis was Slot on the front foot and he was backed later by goalkeeper Alisson, who insisted that the Liverpool squad are firmly behind the manager who won the Premier League.\nThat backing from a senior player was crucial on a night where Slot was asked if he felt his authority was undermined by the whole saga.\nSlot categorically denied he felt that way, even if he was surprised when he heard the quotes on Saturday night.\nThe Liverpool coach did not delve too much into the specifics, insisting that his conversation with Salah was short, but he said enough to explain the situation without inflaming it any further.\nAnd, importantly, the door is still open for Salah even though Slot said he had \"no clue\" whether the 33-year-old has played his last game for the club.\nThe club insist this was mainly because of Salah bringing his own future into question. Their position is that Salah still has a contract and as Slot said, he is a \"firm believer\" in the possibility for a player to return.\nAfter 10 minutes of questions solely focused on Salah, the Liverpool media officer, sitting next to Slot, said it was time to move on to questions about the game itself.\nUltimately though, regardless of how Liverpool fare tomorrow against Inter Milan, this is a story that will continue to dominate the agenda until there is a clear resolution.\nThis video can not be played\n'He's making it all about him' - Murphy on Salah\nThe most iconic and explosive Premier League outbursts\nIs there any way back for Salah and Liverpool?\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?", "source": "BBC", "league": "Premier League", "published_date": "2025-12-08T21:00:31"}

Mistakes were punished tonight and that filtered through. There was an anger in the stadium. The lads are trying. The supporters are angry and I get it.\n\"It's the toughest league in the world and we came into a team who hadn't won since April. I wasn't anticipating a quick turnaround.\"\nRelegation to the Championship is becoming almost an inevitability with Derby County's Premier League low of 11 points under serious threat, so will Wolves avoid becoming the worst team?\nIt's important to distinguish this is a completely different Premier League era to Derby's, so the comparisons may feel unfair.\nIt is not a problem purely based on this season either. Since successive seventh placed finishes in 2018-19 and 2019-20 Wolves have slowly slipped down the table.\nIn the past five seasons they have finished 13th, 10th, 13th, 14th and 16th, having needed to replace the manager at least twice to save themselves.\nEdwards is the fifth head coach in four years and third in less than 12 months afterGary O'NeilandVitor Pereira'ssackings.\nThe revolving door of managers has coincided with major changes in the squad as Wolves have sold and failed to replace their star players.\nRaul Jimenez, Ruben Neves, Adama Traore, Pedro Neto, Max Kilman, Conor Coady and Joao Moutinho were all crucial to success under Nuno Espirito Santo and reaching the Europa League quarter-finals in 2020. The summer exits of Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Matheus Cunha are also still being felt.\nThe five who arrived in the summer, excluding Jorgen Strand Larsen after he made his loan from Celta Vigo permanent, had no Premier League experience and are taking too long to adapt.\nEdwards has already admitted they need more know-how, which will be an aim in January - although who they are able to sign will largely depend on how far adrift they have fallen.\nThere have been concerns about the squad's ability to gel, given the number of nationalities, and their fitness - with boss Edwards eager for them to play with his levels of intensity.\nThe Derby side of 2007-08 had six points at this stage of the season and striker Robert Earnshaw, part of the Rams' squad, knows how badly it can go wrong.\nHe told BBC Sport: \"At Derby, the politics around the club disrupted what was going on in the changing room, on the pitch. It was almost as if everyone gave up, it was 20 games to go and it was like 'we're never going to do it'. There was all this negative talk.\n\"It was not an accident the team finished bottom and struggled for points. The club almost relegated itself. There was too much politics going on.\n\"You can relegate yourself based on how you think. If you come in on Monday morning it's heavier to pick yourself up and heavier to look past the results.\"\n\"You've sold the team, now sell the club\" is a regular chant at Molineux from the South Bank as they direct their anger at owners Fosun and executive chairman Jeff Shi.\nThat will not change Fosun's mindset. If Wolves are relegated they will remain and there are no immediate plans to sell, though they are open to minority investment into Fosun Sports Group, having spoken to former Crystal Palace co-owner John Textor in October.\nFormer director of player recruitment and development Matt Jackson was also promoted to technical director last month, a move met with scepticism by fans who want to see wholesale change.\nEven before November's sacking of Pereira, this season was viewed as a new phase for Wolves in terms of reducing the wage bill and transfer fees - while homegrown players will be targeted both in January and beyond.\nWolves are winless from their opening 15 league games.\nThe all-time English record for a top-flight winless start is held by Bolton, who failed to win any of their first 22 games in 1902-03. Unsurprisingly, they finished bottom and were relegated from the First Division.\nSheffield United's Premier League record of 17 winless games is also under threat.\nWolves will have to beat either Arsenal or Brentford to avoid equalling it before ending the year with trips to Liverpool and Old Trafford.\nThe record for the lowest points tally ever recorded at Christmas in the Premier League belongs to the Blades who had two points in 2020, though that was after 14 games following the pandemic delayed the start to the season.\nSunderland hold the record low for a season which started in August with five points from 17 games.\nWest Brom were bottom at Christmas in 2004 and eight points from safety but, under Bryan Robson, became the first team to survive from that position.\nEarnshaw scored 11 goals in 18 starts to keep the Baggies up in that campaign, but feels Wolves are lacking the quality to make a difference.\nHe said: \"Those moments from top players which change games, in an instant, in five or six seconds - Wolves have not got that at all.\n\"They can't score goals. You should be creating four or five good opportunities every half and they can't buy a goal because there's no quality there.\n\"They've got some very good players - Andre, Joao Gomes, Strand Larsen - but something's not quite right. Is it confidence, ability, not looking forward to the challenge? If you are dreading it as a player that's a real worry.\"", "source": "BBC", "league": "Premier League", "published_date": "2025-12-08T22:40:47"}

And the notion that it is in the best interests of all parties for Salah to have a period away from selection indicates that Liverpool still see a future with the current PFA Players' Player of the Year\nFurthermore, there are currently no plans for Salah to leave Liverpool any earlier than December 15 (which is the latest release date) for the Africa Cup of Nations.\nIt's worth noting Salah's words when he signed his new contract in April: \"I have played eight years here, hopefully it's going to be 10. I'm enjoying my life here, enjoying my football. I have had the best years of my career here.\"\nThere is little doubt that Salah spoke from the heart on Sunday.

And can Palace maintain this level to truly make this a special season in south London?\nGlasner joined Palace in February 2024 following successful stints at Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt.\nThe 51-year-old has since guided Palace to back-to-back record points totals in the Premier League and led them to a first major trophy when they triumphed over Manchester City in the FA Cup last season.\nThat led to a first ever appearance in a major European competition - although it was downgraded from Europa League to Europa Conference League because of multi-club ownership rules - while they also beat league winners Liverpool to win the Community Shield.\nFormer Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher said on Sky Sports: \"We are watching the best manager and the best team in Crystal Palace's history.\n\"Those supporters could not have dreamed what would happen to their football club when that man came in.\"\nSelhurst Park has become one of the toughest places for teams to play with Palace unbeaten there in the league this season until defeat by United last weekend.\nOn the road, their form is arguably even better.\nSince Glasner's first game in charge in March 2024, only Arsenal (65), Liverpool (57) and Manchester City (55) have won more Premier League points away from home than Crystal Palace (52).\nBut the defeat by United prompted Glasner tocriticise the clubas he suggested the club-record Â£60m brought in by the sale of Eberechi Eze this summer has not been reinvested in the squad.\nHis side have lost all four league matches they have played after a midweek European match this season, suggesting squad depth and juggling the increased schedule demands has been a problem.\nAnd Glasner was quick to point it out, saying the club had \"thrown away\" the chance to play an even better season by not spending in the summer.\n\"When he gets a result he doesn't like, he is not shy in being outspoken about the board or the sporting director,\" said Carragher.\n\"They probably have to take it on the chin because he is the greatest manager in their history.\"\nIt is clear Glasner is an ambitious manager.\nIt is perhaps also clear that he feels he is being held back by a lack of depth in the squad while he will hope his comments spark a flurry of January transfer window action.\nGlasner's contract is set to expire in June and the ambitions of the club and the manager will need to align quickly if the success they are currently enjoying is to continue.\n\"There's a huge talking point around Glasner himself with his contract,\" former Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given told BBC Sport.\n\"If you're a director you're trying to tie him down. The job he's done is phenomenal - winning the FA Cup and Charity Shield and getting Palace into Europe. You couldn't ask for any more.\n\"He was angry and upset after the United game as he felt he wasn't backed in the summer. It will be interesting to see what happens in January and the summer and if they back him.\"\nGuehi's contract runs out at the end of the season and interest from Liverpool in the England defender, who was close to a move away from Palace this summer, is only going to intensify given their defensive troubles.\nProlific playmaker Wharton is a man in demand with several clubs interested in his services.\nMeanwhile, talented players like Ismaila Sarr, who is currently injured but will soon be heading to Afcon, and Jean-Philippe Mateta will certainly have dreams of playing Champions League football.\n\"The squad's not big enough to rest players and it puts more strain on the Premier League games. Top six would be an unbelievable season but big clubs will be trying to do the same,\" Given added.\nThis Palace squad might be in their greatest period ever but they are also on the brink of potentially disbanding with the possibility of a stellar campaign being derailed.\nLatest Crystal Palace news, analysis and fan views\nAsk about Crystal Palace - what do you want to know?", "source": "BBC", "league": "Premier League", "published_date": "2025-12-07T21:47:07"}
{"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cly139x2d1yo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "title": "'Everyone follows fashion' - is Premier League better now than 20 years ago?", "content": "There seems to be an ongoing debate about how good the Premier League is now, and if it is better than 10 or 20 years ago.\nThe discussion about that in the media or from fans is usually about the quality of football or how exciting it is compared to even a decade ago.\nThis is my view, but from a manager's perspective.\nBefore I start, I want to spell out that I am writing as a former manager, giving my opinion on the game we all love. I would be fascinated to find out what your views are about it.\nWhat do you think about your team's performances? Are you watching a more cultured, possession-based style now than you did 10 or 20 years ago - or are you watching your team play without the drive and commitment of years gone by?\nMy opinion is not only based on performance or style, but also how much has changed off the pitch.\nWalk into most grounds today, as a supporter, manager or player, and you can't help but be impressed. Our stadiums and facilities are the equal or even the envy of any country in world football.\nExactly the same could be said about our training grounds, with state-of-the-art fitness and medical centres of the highest calibre, and the pitches are like bowling greens - absolute perfect surfaces, to play and train on.\nBut has everything changed for the better? Everyone will have a different view on that, but from a manager's perspective these are the areas that matter.\nBrighton, under majority owner and chairman Tony Bloom, are one of only three Premier League clubs to be controlled by English owners, along with Brentford and Tottenham\nI managed 10 clubs and had eight chairmen who were local owners. They were almost as one with the supporters, and understood the value of the club to the community.\nMy relationship with some of them was very strong and I still have great respect for those individuals.\nFor me, understanding the identities of the clubs and towns where I worked without doubt gave me more of a connection with the supporters.\nWorking closely together with my chairman, building a bond between us and having a mutual understanding with them, was always vital for me, especially in difficult moments - and there were lots of them!\nIt enabled me to speak openly with them, often over dinner, and discuss the club's development from my point of view as well as theirs.\nIn my view, it was and still is, the most important relationship at any club, but it is only a dream for the majority of managers today.\nMost Premier League clubs, and many in the Championship, have owners and investors who are based abroad.\nFor these individuals or groups, football is a business and making profits counts as much as gaining points. It's not an option for the manager to sit down with them over a glass of wine to discuss footballing matters.\nWith these changes, more and more different job titles are brought in, from sporting director to director of football and more, that decrease or ultimately prevent any contact personally between the coach or manager and owner.\nIf I was still a manager today, I know which set-up I'd prefer.\nThose in charge of Brighton, Brentford, Stoke, Middlesbrough and Bristol City, where the owners are in England and have a local and personal understanding of the community, should thank their lucky stars.\nNottingham Forest's former Newcastle midfielder Elliot Anderson was back at St James' Park in October. The Magpies were forced to sell the 23-year-old in 2024 to balance the books under PSR rules\nI often hear \"he's one of our own\" proudly shouted by fans, and I love it. It's a symbolic way of showing how much supporters love watching home-grown talent break into their club's first team.\nThe academy system in this country has an enormous pull on young players. Now pre-academy players can join a club when as young as six, and can end up spending more time at the academy than at school.\nThese boys are often local lads who, during their journey, build a strong relationship with the club and their coaches.\nI'm old enough to remember the three West Ham players who helped England win their only World Cup, in 1966 at Wembley, and I am sure everyone reading this can relate to the home-grown talent in your team, and how special the feeling is to know \"he's one of our own\".\nUnfortunately, today's academy players seem to be viewed differently, from a business perspective.\nClubs have realised they can make pure profit from selling academy players and, to balance their finances, top talent is being sacrificed to meet profit and sustainability rules (PSR).\nThis is something that maybe has only just started too. Now, clubs are spending enormous amounts of cash to fill academies with good young foreign talent.\nIs this a football decision, or a future financial 'get out of jail' ticket?\nGuardiola took charge of Manchester City in the summer of 2016\nIt is nine years since Pep Guardiola arrived at Manchester City and brought with him a style of play that was to be followed - and copied - by coaches up and down the country, from the highest professional level to the amateur and youth game.\nAs I talked about in a previous column aboutthe value of defending properly,Pep's style of play did not just become 'the right way' to play, it also became 'the only way'.\nAt the time, without question, City had the strongest squad of players, technically, in the Premier League, but it felt like many other managers and coaches put style over substance and, irrespective of their strengths, many teams were encouraged to play possession-based football.\nI always played to my own squad's strengths, and have never changed my views on that principle, but you still have to admire the complete revolution that Pep and City created.\nPossession football, with passes through the pitch and end products to finish off the phases of play, is fantastic to watch.\nBut possession football, where the goalkeeper and centre-backs play square passes back and forth, is not fantastic to watch!\nIn my younger days, we were coached to have our first touch forward, and then to play forward to the best technical players we had on the pitch, who usually were the wide players and centre-forwards.\nFootball is not, and should not be conditional - where you play a certain way regardless of the type of players you have got.\nStill, fashions keep on changing. Set-plays have come into fashion with almost every team now trying long throws and in-swinging corners. Teams who were being pressed by opposition forwards at goal-kicks are now playing long, to beat it.\nA certain change of wind direction is taking place, and maybe it has turned back a notch. Even my old assistant, David Kemp, has been in his wardrobe to bring out his old bell-bottom jeans - for those of you reading who are too young to remember, they used to be in fashion in the 1970s.\nAs a manager, I always saw my job was to get results. Maybe substance over style is the direction the Premier League is heading in now?\nTony Pulis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "source": "BBC", "league": "Premier League", "published_date": "2025-12-07T19:58:33"}

It will now only intensify after Salah chose to air so much dirty laundry in public.\nThe cracks are now wide open after Salah made one of his rare post-match pronouncements that turned into a bitter attack on his head coach and the club.\nIt was a verbal assault that missed no-one as he said: \"It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame.\"\nSalah did not specify who he meant, but he made it crystal clear he no longer has any relationship with Slot.\nFor a club that pride themselves on keeping matters in-house, on stability and calm, Salah's outburst has blown discontent inside Anfield into the open. It is an astonishing show of rebellion from a player who has rightly achieved all-time great status.\nAnd, to make matters worse for Slot and Liverpool, it came after Salah had spent a third successive Premier League game sitting on the bench, this time watching them concede a last-gasp equaliser to draw 3-3 at Leeds United having led 2-0.\nSalah says he has been 'thrown under the bus' by Liverpool\nMohamed Salah says his relationship for Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has \"broken down\"\nSlot has not had to go looking for problems as Liverpool have slumped this season, despite spending almost Â£450m in the summer.\nBut the biggest landed when Salah decided to go public with obvious fury at his treatment.\nSalah uses his words carefully and strategically. At most matches since arriving at Anfield from Roma in 2017, he has declined requests to talk to waiting reporters.\nThis only changes at Salah's behest, like when he stood outside St Mary's in the teeth of Storm Bert last November after scoring twice in a 3-2 win at Southampton to announce he was \"probably more out than in\" at Liverpool as contract negotiations were slow to progress.\nThe impasse was resolved when he signed a two-year deal in April, Salah marking the deal by sitting on a throne in his Liverpool kit at a floodlit Anfield.\nIt was all a far cry from the rancour that was exposed at Elland Road on Saturday night.\nSalah is now more out than in than he has ever been. And if his time at Liverpool ends in such acrimony, it will be a sad farewell.\nIf Salah's words are a challenge to Liverpool and Slot, then it is a battle he is far less likely to win than he was at this time last season.\nIt is understandable that such a proud character would be hurt by being relegated to the bench, such has been his standing at Liverpool.\nSalah has won two Premier League titles, the Champions League, the FA Cup and the EFL Cup at Liverpool, scoring 250 goals. In the Premier League, he has scored 188 goals and provided 88 assists.\nHe is third on Liverpool's all-time list of goalscorers, behind Ian Rush and Roger Hunt.\nThis season, however, Salah has started to look his age. It was not the seismic shock it might once have been when Slot dropped him to the bench for the 2-0 win at West Ham United.\nSalah's form this term has offered a stark contrast to last season, when he seemed driven by a personal mission to bring the league title back to Anfield, which he duly did, scoring 34 goals in 50 starts in all competitions.\nIn this campaign, Salah has made 16 starts, scoring only five times.\nSlot, a head coach searching for answers as the champions struggled, needed to look for solutions and one of those was dropping Salah.\nThe Dutchman also had to explore how he would cope without Salah, not just immediately but in the longer term as he prepares to join Egypt in the Africa Cup of Nations on 15 December.\nSalah's form did not warrant automatic inclusion as it once did at Liverpool. He has been flirting with the bench for some time, although this should never downgrade how he has been a world-class match-winner for so long.\nThe legs have not looked as sprightly as they once did. The goals have not been flowing like the torrent of old. Even greats like Salah cannot defy the passage of time.\nThe next game at Anfield, when Liverpool play Brighton on Saturday, will be played out under the most intense microscope, especially if Slot and Salah are in close proximity.\nSalah is the idol of Liverpool's fans, who have not turned their anger on Slot despite such a drop in form and standards this season.\nLiverpool's next step will also be intriguing, but it is hard to see them sacrificing a manager because of criticism from a player reaching the end of his career, no matter how magnificent that career has been.\nSalah's status and steely character has shown him challenge authority before, such as when he engaged in a furious touchline spat with manager Jurgen Klopp when West Ham scored while he was waiting to come on as a substitute in April 2024.\nOn that occasion, Salah declined to stop in the mixed zone, the area where players can choose to speak to the media, simply saying: \"If I speak, there will be fire.\"\nSalah chose to speak at Elland Road. And that has started an inferno for Slot and Liverpool.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?", "source": "BBC", "league": "Premier League", "published_date": "2025-12-06T23:36:20"}

But their best XI can beat anybody,\" Murphy said.\nDefeat at Villa Park was Arsenal's first loss in 18 games - since going down 1-0 at Liverpool in August - and significantly weakens what had looked a commanding position at the top.\nWith just two wins from their past five Premier League games, Arsenal fans could be starting to get nervous.\nBuendia scores with last kick as Villa beat Arsenal\nThis video can not be played\n'They could still go up another level' - Sutton\nVilla had an expected goals (xG) tally of 2.27 on Saturday, the highest by any team against the Gunners in the Premier League this season, and created five big chances, including the goals for Matty Cash and Buendia.\nThey have have scored 5.45 more goals [22 in total] than their xG [16.55] and conceded 5.83 fewer goals [15] than their xGA [20.83] in the Premier League this season.\nThe latter metric -  expected goals against - measures how many goals a team would be expected to concede based on the chances created against them.\nVilla's director of football operations and Emery's trusted lieutenant Damian Vidagany wrote on X after last week's 1-0 win over Wolves that it did not matter if Villa scored from the moon, just that they were getting the points.\nBuendia is now Villa's joint top Premier League scorer with Donyell Malen on four goals - Ollie Watkins, Morgan Rogers and Cash have three - so Villa are also not relying on one player to put the ball in the net.\nThey may be outperforming expected goals figures at both ends of the pitch, but few would begrudge Villa their place near the summit.\nNo team has won more Premier League games since the start of March than Villa.\n\"I am not thinking in it [the title],\" said Emery. \"I know 38 matches is very difficult. We are not a contender. If we were in game 35, perhaps we can speak differently.\n\"Three points gives us a lot of confidence and it gives us a lot of feelings together about how we are doing in this way. The table, we are feeling better about it than two months ago.\n\"[I am] so proud of how we are responding and how we focus on each match, also in Europe. The players are the protagonists.\"\nIt is a long way from Villa's early-season struggles when they failed to win any of their opening six games - including going out to Brentford in the Carabao Cup.\nThey did not score in the Premier League until their sixth game, a 1-1 draw against 10-man Sunderland, but since that point in late September they have won 13 out of 15 games.\nEmery acknowledged their form is the best he could have expected, having been third bottom when leaving the Stadium of Light on 21 September.\nHe said: \"How we are now, I am so proud of the players, how they are taking the challenges we are sending in the dressing room. But it is the reality, the reality is everything we are achieving, but the reality as well is the difficulties we are going to face.\n\"The Premier League is very difficult and our target in 38 matches, we will see it, but of course now we are feeling good and feeling strong and feeling comfortable in the position we are.\"\nIt was just the second time Arsenal had conceded two goals in a game this season\nArsenal have had to contend with injuries to key players this season.\nAgainst Villa, the absences looked to be taking a toll on the Gunners.\nThe treatment room has been busy this season, and players who have spent time out of action have included William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard, Noni Madueke, Cristhian Mosquera and Viktor Gyokeres.\nDefenders Saliba, Mosquera and Gabriel are all unavailable for now, which meant that Jurrien Timber, who usually plays right-back, had to fill in at centre-back at Villa.\nGyokeres, building up his fitness, came on to replace makeshift striker Mikel Merino at Villa Park, but the Â£64m striker failed to make an impact.\nLeandro Trossard has been a standout for Arsenal this season but he too is coming back from injury.

We are going to have to prove we can cope again, again, again for another six months,\" he said.\n\"That is the level. People who think at this moment we are going to be 10 points clear live in a different world.\n\"That is the league - you go to Old Trafford, you go to St James' Park, you go to Chelsea, you come here, we have been in a lot of difficult grounds.\n\"The result could have been different, the reality is not. We went 18 games unbeaten and still we are there.\n\"That is the level of the league. That is the opportunity that we have ahead of us and that's it. Now it is time to bounce back, they have given me all the right reasons to think we are going to perform at the same level.\n\"We move on. We will learn from today and it will make us a better team.\"\nThis is a shaky spell, with the loss to Villa coming after draws against Chelsea and Sunderland.\nArsenal had an impressive recent win over Tottenham and also a comfortable victory over Brentford, but their once dominant lead has been shredded.\nWith a record of not converting strong starts into trophies, Arsenal fans might well be getting nervous, but the message from the manager is to stay calm.", "source": "BBC", "league": "Premier League", "published_date": "2025-12-06T16:48:25"}

I have to say the crowd has given him incredible support, and that gives [players] incredible energy.\n\"His goal was great for him because he has earned it.\"\nBarry scores first Everton goal to help beat Forest\nBarry was brought in by Moyes in the summer from Villarreal, replacing the departed Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\nHis record in Spain's top flight had been decent with 11 goals from 35 games, but the transition to the Premier League has proven difficult.\nPrior to the Forest game he had managed just one shot on target in 16 games - the sort of record that would generally have fans questioning the wisdom of such a player leading their line.\nHowever, Barry is popular among Everton fans for his other contributions, such as his work rate and ability to win headers, the only thing that was missing was goals.\nUntil now.\nHis finish, taken in such a composed manner that you could have been fooled into thinking it was his 15th of the season, seemed to be celebrated that bit more loudly than normal among the home supporters. They no doubt shared Barry's sense of elation and relief.\nThe goal came from the 19th shot he has attempted for Everton and was his first strike since netting for Villarreal against Osasuna in La Liga in May.\nThe 23-year-old also went off to a big standing ovation when he was replaced by Beto - another player who has been struggling for goals - in the second half.\nBut while Barry's all-round play is appreciated by fans, a striker is ultimately judged on goals. The longer his barren run went on, the more the pressure had increased on him.\n\"It's huge for him, and it was coming - it was certainly due,\" Moyes told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"He's got to score, when you're playing centre-forward, otherwise we will find someone to replace him.\"\nThere are some things that are meant to just go together - bread and butter, fish and chips and, clearly, Everton and David Moyes.\nThe 62-year-old returned for his second spell at the club in January, replacing the man who now leads Forest - Sean Dyche.\nSince coming back, Moyes has turned Everton from the relegation battlers they have been in recent seasons to a side now contending for European football.\nWith 15 victories from 36 games, Moyes has a win percentage that is similar to his first spell (41.67% now compared to 42.08%), suggesting he has effectively picked up from where he left off when he departed for Manchester United 12 years ago.\nBut the Scot has been a manager long enough to know that now is not the time to get carried away over what Everton could potentially achieve this season.\n\"I want to be positive, I want to say we will try and attempt to get close to Europe,\" he said.\n\"We are not a side yet who will win games all the time, but we are making good progress.\"\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone", "source": "BBC", "league": "Premier League", "published_date": "2025-12-06T18:52:05"}
